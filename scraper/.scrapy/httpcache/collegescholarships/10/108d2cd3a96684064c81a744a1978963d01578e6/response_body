      <h2> Are Your Majoring in Psychology?     </h2>
	  
<p>Psychology continues to be one of the most popular majors for college   students, and it is not difficult to understand why. Beyond the   inherent fascination of the subject, a degree in psychology can lead to a   wide variety of career paths. Psychology majors may pursue careers at   every level of the mental healthcare profession, from school counseling   to private practice. A psychology degree is also a firm foundation for a   career in business, education, or social work.</p>
<p>Students majoring in psychology will be studying at the   undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate levels. Their ultimate career   choice will dictate the type of degree needed to enter the workforce.   But whether pursuing an associate&rsquo;s degree or a master&rsquo;s degree, all   psychology students have one thing in common &ndash; the need for financial   assistance to help them meet the ever rising costs of tuition.   Fortunately, there are scholarship programs dedicated to helping   promising psychology majors find the money they need to pursue their   education.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.collegescholarships.org/images/psychology-students.jpg" width="425" class="aligncenter" height="282" alt="psychology student  scholarships" /></p>
<p>Scholarships for psychology majors are typically sponsored by   professional associations and advocacy groups. Colleges and universities   are also prime source for valuable scholarships dedicated to students   majoring in psychology and its many sub-disciplines. These programs   offer valuable financial assistance to promising students, but they are   also highly competitive. Students looking for scholarships to help them   pursue a degree in psychology should be prepared to work hard for their   awards.</p>
<h2>Scholarships from Professional Associations</h2>
<p>A large proportion of the available scholarships for psychology   majors are funded and administered by the private sector. These programs   are typically sponsored by professional associations closely allied to   the mental healthcare industry. The majority of these scholarship   programs are directed at graduate level and post-graduate level   students. While there are scholarships for undergraduates sponsored by   the private sector, many beginning students will find greater   opportunities pursuing more general scholarships and grants before   focusing on specific programs dedicated to psychology majors.</p>
<p>The following examples of psychology scholarships should illustrate   the types of programs sponsored by professional associations.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.nasponline.org/" target="_blank">National Association of School Psychologists</a>&nbsp; sponsors the annual <a href="http://www.nasponline.org/about_nasp/minority-scholarship-program.aspx" target="_blank">NASP Minority Scholarship Program for Graduate Training in School Psychology</a>.   The program awards $5000 in scholarship funds to minority students who   are working towards a graduate degree in school psychology. The award is   open to African-American, Hispanic-American, Asian-American and   Native-American students who are enrolled at least part-time at an   accredited college or university. Applicants must be an NASP student   member.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.apa.org/" target="_blank">American Psychological Association</a> works with a wide range of organizations to sponsor undergraduate and   graduate level scholarships and grants for students pursuing careers in a   variety of psychological disciplines. Students can use the APA&rsquo;s   website to locate financial aid programs dedicated to their specific   field of study. Available awards range from one time scholarships and   grants to renewable fellowships and dissertation awards.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.psichi.org/" target="_blank">Psi Chi, The International Honor Society of Psychology</a> sponsors a number of one time awards for undergraduate and graduate students. <a href="http://www.psichi.org/awards/completelist_awards.aspx" target="_blank">Psi Chi&rsquo;s awards and grants</a> include the&nbsp; <em><strong>Allyn &amp; Bacon Award</strong></em>, the <em><strong>Newman Graduate Award</strong></em> and the <em><strong>Psi Chi Junior Scientist Fellowship</strong></em>. Award amounts vary according to program.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.nsfgrfp.org/" target="_blank">National Science Foundation</a> &ndash; NSF offers its annual <a href="http://www.nsfgrfp.org/about_the_program" target="_blank">Graduate Research Fellowship Program</a> which is open to all science majors, including psychology majors, who   are involved in research at the graduate level. Benefits include a three   year $30,000 allowance plus $10,500 for tuition and fees.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.epilepsyfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Epilepsy Foundation</a> sponsors a <a href="http://www.epilepsyfoundation.org/research/behavioral-sciences-student-fellowship.cfm" target="_blank">Behavioral Sciences Student Fellowship</a> for graduate level students studying behavioral psychology and its   relation to epilepsy. Awards are determined according to research   outline submissions, and past academic performance.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.najanet.org/" target="_blank">National Association of Junior Auxiliaries</a> sponsors the annual <a href="http://www.najanet.org/view/91" target="_blank">NAJA Scholarship</a>.   To be eligible, students must be pursuing their graduate studies in   counseling, psychology and mental health as they relate to the needs of   children and young adults. Award amounts vary. If more than one   scholarship year is required to complete the student&rsquo;s studies, they may   reapply provided all previous agreements have been satisfactorily   discharged.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Scholarships from Colleges and Universities</h2>
<p>Students looking for psychology scholarships will find that their own   college or university may be&nbsp; a prime source for the financial aid they   need to continue their studies. Colleges and universities routinely   offer scholarships for exceptional students as a way to bring the best   and brightest to their campuses. College sponsored scholarships are   typically strictly merit-based, and students will have to work hard to   earn theses awards.</p>
<p>Psychology majors looking for scholarship opportunities should   contact their school&rsquo;s office of financial aid to learn about programs   that may be open to them. Students should also consult their department   heads for information on campus-based scholarships as well as outside   financial aid programs.</p>
<p>The following examples are typical of the type of psychology scholarships offered by colleges and universities.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.uwlax.edu/index.asp" target="_blank">University of Wisconsin La Crosse</a> has one of the more impressive psychology programs in the country. The   university routinely offers scholarships for psychology majors at both   the undergraduate and graduate level. In addition to the school&rsquo;s <em><strong>CSL Excellence Award</strong></em>, students may apply for the <em><strong>Donna Hansen Scholarship</strong></em>, the <em><strong>Thomas Harris Scholarship </strong></em>and the <em><strong>Alan Howe Scholarship</strong></em>.   These scholarships are made possible by the generous donations the   university&rsquo;s alumni. Award amounts vary according to availability of   funds, and number of applicants per year.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.psych.umn.edu/ugrad/" target="_blank">University of Minnesota</a> hosts a distinguished undergraduate program for psychology majors. Each year the university awards several <a href="http://www.psych.umn.edu/ugrad/mortensen/academicscholarships.html" target="_blank">Mortensen Scholarships</a> for students enrolled in its Department of Psychology. These   scholarships are awarded on the basis of academic merit, with special   attention being given to the applicant&rsquo;s extracurricular activities and   volunteer work. The award amount is $1000.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.strose.edu/" target="_blank">College of Saint Rose</a> in Albany, New York is one of the country&rsquo;s leading private colleges.   With departments specializing in psychology and school psychology, they   attract some of the best students from across the country. While they do   not offer any scholarships dedicated solely to psychology majors, they   do provide an impressive selection of scholarships for their attending   students. The <em><strong>Trustees Scholarship</strong></em> provides $14,000 in funds per year to eligible students, while the <em><strong>Provosts Scholarship</strong></em> offers up to $9000 per year. The <em><strong>College of Saint Rose</strong></em> also offers a $4000 scholarship for transfer students who are migrating   from another college to complete their studies at Saint Rose. All   scholarship awards are determined on the basis of academic performance,   community service and leadership potential.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.thechicagoschool.edu/Home" target="_blank">Chicago School of Professional Psychology</a> has campuses in Illinois, California and Washington D.C. As one of the   country&rsquo;s leading psychology graduate schools they offer degrees in   everything from clinical psychology to business psychology. The school   offers several annual scholarships, including the <em><strong>Merit Scholarship</strong></em>, the <em><strong>President&rsquo;s Scholarship</strong></em> and the <em><strong>Global Impact Scholarship</strong></em>.   Awards are based on a combination of merit and financial need, with an   emphasis on building an ethnically diverse student body. Award amounts   range from $1000 to $10,000.</li>
</ul>
<p>Campus-based scholarships for psychology majors are plentiful, and   are as diverse as the many sub-disciplines that fall under the   psychology umbrella. Students should begin their search by focusing on   those schools that offer degrees in their chosen field of psychology,   and contact the university&rsquo;s office of financial aid for details on   possible financial aid opportunities.</p>
<p>The field of psychology is broad and offers students a wide range of   career opportunities. Whether you are drawn to clinical research,   private practice or social work; whether you plan to apply your degree   to the schoolroom or the boardroom; majoring in psychology offers the   possibility of a lucrative and rewarding professional career. With the   right scholarship you can be on your way to realizing your educational   and professional goals.</p>
