          <h2>The Scholarship Layer Cake </h2>
          <p>Scholarships are a vital resource for college-bound students looking   to supplement their education fund. Few students can afford to pay for   college without some form of financial aid, and scholarship programs   make it possible for many aspiring students to achieve their educational   goals. Subject-specific scholarships are designed for students with   definite educational and career interests. They may be funded by federal   or state governments, corporations or private institutions. </p>
          <p>Finding the   right scholarship program may at first seem daunting, but with due   diligence and a bit of research students can find scholarships dedicated   to nearly every field of endeavor. Our A &ndash; Z list of subject-specific   scholarships will act as a guide through the general fields of academic   study, and lead you to hundreds of career specific scholarship programs   designed to help students realize their educational and professional   goals.</p>
          <h3>How to Access the List of Scholarships</h3>
          <p>Each of the subject links in the list below will take you directly to   our dedicated section on scholarship programs for that chosen   discipline. For example, the <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/engineering-students.htm">Engineering</a>&nbsp;   link will lead to a web-page with general engineering scholarships,   which will then provide further links to scholarship programs dedicated   to more specific engineering fields such as <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/engineering/aerospace.htm">aerospace </a>,<a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/engineering/chemical.htm"> chemical engineering</a> and <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/engineering/materials-science.htm">material science</a>.   Each of these pages will in turn provide links to information on highly   targeted scholarship programs within the chosen field. In this way, you   can narrow your search for applicable scholarship programs to find the   one that best suits your status as a student, your educational   background and your ultimate career goal.</p>

          <h2>Using the subject specific scholarship list by Degree Level</h2>
          <p>Scholarship programs typically make distinctions for undergraduate   and graduate students. As you narrow your focus to more subject-specific   scholarships, you will find that they begin to target graduate and   post-graduate students who are at an advanced level of study in their   chosen field. Freshman and sophomore students will find this list to be a   useful tool in deciding on a college major, and in finding <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/undergraduate-students.htm">undergraduate scholarship</a> opportunities suitable for the beginning of their college career.</p>
          <h2>Popular Subject Specific Scholarships</h2>
          <p>The majority of of scholarship programs, particularly as they apply   to undergraduates, will be attached to fields of study defined as   &ldquo;interdisciplinary&rdquo;. These are general subjects that require the   integration of multiple fields of study in order to complete a full and   balanced degree level education. As students progress along their   educational path, scholarships will become more subject-specific,   targeting distinct study programs within a wider discipline. General   scholarships in <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/social-sciences.htm">social science </a>, <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/communications.htm">communications </a>, <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/librarian-students.htm">library science&nbsp;</a> and <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/physical-life.htm">physical and life sciences&nbsp;</a> will ultimately lead to more specific programs for graduate level students pursuing detailed studies in their chosen fields.</p>
          <p>Scholarships will be found at all levels, in the following popular fields of study.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Business</li>
            <li>History</li>
            <li>Mathematics</li>
            <li>Information Technology</li>
            <li>Science</li>
            <li>Engineering</li>
            <li>English</li>
            <li>Foreign Language Studies</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>General Studies Scholarships</h3>
          <p>General studies are the foundation of any college degree program, and   comprise the typical educational path chosen by most undergraduate   students. General study programs cover a wide range of liberal arts   fields, including the <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/social-sciences.htm">social sciences</a>, <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/journalism-students.htm">journalism</a>, and <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/history-students.htm">history</a>.   College graduates with a general studies, or liberal arts, degree will   be prepared for a variety of career positions in the general workforce.   They will also have laid the groundwork for further post-graduate   studies required to gain a more specific professional degree.</p>
          <p>General studies scholarships are sponsored by a variety of sources,   and college-bound students will find a full range of programs supported   by federal and state governments, universities and private   organizations.</p>
          <div align="center"><img src="https://collegescholarships.org/images/subject-specific-scholarships.jpg" width="426" height="282" alt="subject specific scholarships" /></div>
          <h3>Business Scholarships</h3>
          <p>Degrees in business, and business-related fields such as<a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/business/forensic-accounting.htm"> Forensic Accounting</a>, <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/business/marketing.htm">Marketing</a>&nbsp; and <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/business/entrepreneur.htm">entrepreneurship </a>,   remain extremely popular with college-bound students. Business studies   offer students the education they need to enter the professional   business world at a variety of levels, from marketing to management;   from accounting to IT. Students pursuing a career in business will find   scholarship programs sponsored by corporations, universities and   professional associations. Business-related scholarships are readily   available for both undergraduate and graduate students.</p>
          <h2>Subject Specific Scholarships that Draw Minorities and Women</h2>
          <p>Many scholarship programs are specifically designed to encourage and support<a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/women.htm"> women</a> and <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/other-minority-scholarships.htm">minority students</a> who are pursuing degrees and careers in fields that have been   historically dominated by the white male establishment. Some of the more   extensive scholarship programs benefiting minorities and women are   dedicated to the STEM subjects of science, technology, engineering and   mathematics. These fields are currently suffering from a critical   shortage of qualified students and professionals. In an effort to expand   and diversify both the national student body, and the professional   workforce, many institutions and organizations sponsor lucrative   scholarships for those interested in pursuing a degree in one of the   STEM disciplines.</p>
          <h2>Who funds STEM scholarships?</h2>
          <p>Scholarships for the STEM fields are funded by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The Federal government</li>
            <li>Local State governments</li>
            <li>Colleges and universities</li>
            <li>Professional associations</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Scholarships in High Need Fields</h2>
          <p>Many professional fields are currently experiencing critical manpower   shortages that threaten to adversely impact local and state   communities. In an effort to attract students to these much needed   career paths, a variety of scholarship programs have been put in place   by both the public and private sectors. Critical need fields include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Nursing and auxiliary healthcare</li>
            <li>Teaching and Special Education</li>
            <li>Social work</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Healthcare Scholarships</h3>
          <p><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/health-science.htm">Health and Medical Science Scholarships</a> offer lucrative funding opportunities for students looking to enter the   healthcare profession. Many of these programs are   scholarship-for-service agreements, requiring students to commit to a   predetermined period of service in an under-served medical facility in   exchange for financial aid. Healthcare scholarships are supported by   federal and state governments, colleges and universities, and   professional associations.</p>
      <p>Students interested in pursuing a career in healthcare will find a   variety of scholarship opportunities dedicated to all&nbsp; aspects of the   healthcare profession, including <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/physical-therapy.htm"> physical therapy</a>, <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/psychiatry.htm">psychiatry</a>, <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/gynecology.htm">gynecology</a> and <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/anesthesiology.htm">anesthesiology</a>.   The wide range of healthcare career choices continues to attract   students with the promise of good salaries, impressive benefits and   secure employment.</p>
          <h3>Nursing Scholarships<img src="../images/nursing-grants.jpg" alt="nursing scholarships" width="333" height="360" align="right" /></h3>
          <p>The United States is currently experiencing a nationwide shortage of   qualified nurses at all levels of the healthcare industry. Inner cities   and rural areas are particularly hard hit by these nursing shortages,   and many scholarship programs have been put in place to help attract   students to this much needed profession. Again, many nursing   scholarships will require students to commit to a period of service in a   facility, or community, that is suffering from a severe shortage of   qualified nurses.</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/nursing.htm">Nursing scholarships</a> are available at both the undergraduate and graduate level, and are often specific to certain nursing disciplines such as<a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/nursing/emergency.htm"> Emergency Nursing</a>, <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/nursing/neonatal.htm">Neonatal Nursing</a>&nbsp; and <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/nursing/community-health.htm">Community Health Nursing</a>.   Nursing scholarships are available from a variety of sources, including   federal and state governments, professional organizations, colleges and   technical schools.</p>
          <h3>Teaching Scholarships</h3>
          <p>Teachers and educators are always in high demand, and there is   currently a critical shortage of qualified teachers for advanced   subjects such as science and mathematics. There is also a national   shortage of educators specializing in <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/education/special-ed.htm">special education</a> services.This has led to the creation of a number of scholarships that   encourage and support students who are pursuing degrees in <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/teaching-students.htm">teaching and education</a>.   Many of these are scholarship-for-service programs that provide   financial aid for students who commit to a teaching contract in   under-served and at risk communities. These scholarship programs are   typically supported by local, state and federal governments, as well as   colleges and professional associations.</p>
          <h3>Scholarships for Social Workers</h3>
          <p>Social workers fill a desperate need in communities around the   country, and students interested in working with the disadvantaged, the   at risk, or the under-represented will find a variety of scholarship   programs designed to help them achieve their professional goals. Social   workers may find themselves working with the mentally or physically   disabled, the elderly and with children from disadvantaged backgrounds.   It is a challenging profession that brings incalculable rewards.</p>
          <p>Scholarships for <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/social-worker.htm">social workers</a> are typically supported by state and local governments, private foundations and universities.</p>
          <h2>Vocational and Trade Scholarships</h2>
      <p>A liberal arts, or professional, degree is not the goal of all high   school graduates. A new generation of students are turning to vocational   and trade schools as an alternative to the traditional four year   college program. Vocational schools provide a much needed pathway to   well paying careers for hard working, self motivated, students.   Scholarships for trade and vocational schools make it possible for many   high school graduates to get the training and education they need to   move seamlessly into financially rewarding careers. Vocational and Trade   Schools often offer their own scholarship programs to students for whom   a four year university is not the preferred choice. Trade-oriented   fields such as <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/agriculture.htm">agriculture</a>, <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/auto-students.htm">automotive repair</a>, <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/cosmetology.htm">cosmetology</a> and <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/hvac-students.htm">Heating and Air Conditioning Repair&nbsp;</a> provide their own scholarship opportunities for eligible students.</p>
          <p>There are hundreds of thousands of dollars available every year in   scholarship awards for hardworking students eager to pursue their   educational and professional goals. Begin your search for suitable   scholarship programs by narrowing your focus from general studies to   your specific career goals, and target those scholarship programs that   best match your professional interests and your status as a student.   With a bit of research you will soon find the scholarship program that   will help you to realize your dreams of a higher education.</p>
