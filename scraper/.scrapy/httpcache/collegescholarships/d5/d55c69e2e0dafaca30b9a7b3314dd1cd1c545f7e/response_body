      <h2> Protect Your Bank Account and Serve Your Community     </h2>
	  
<p>Law enforcement careers span a broad range of specialties that   includes investigative work and civil service at all levels.&nbsp; United   States Secret Service, <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/" target="_blank">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> and countless local law enforcement agencies require steady streams of   well-trained professionals to protect and serve.&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparatory education   is drawn from university criminal justice programs, but other majors   lead to law enforcement careers too.&nbsp; Psychology, <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/accounting-students.htm">accounting</a>, sociology and other specialized degrees provide strong foundations for work in law enforcement.</p>
<p>Earning certificates, associate&rsquo;s&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/undergraduate-students.htm">bachelor&rsquo;s degrees</a>,   and advanced criminal justice credentials are academic pursuits that   require higher education financing. Criminal justice and related majors   qualify for large-scale federal financial aid and state-administered   general education funds, but committed law enforcement hopefuls also   enjoy access to <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/subject-specific.htm">career-specific funding</a> set aside specifically for future defenders of personal liberty.<img src="https://www.collegescholarships.org/images/law-enforcement-scholarships.jpg" width="282" class="alignright" height="426" alt="law enforcement scholarships" /></p>
<p>A catch-all approach to law enforcement education funding looks at   federal, state and local resources; especially industry associations,   foundations, government agencies and campus-specific financial aid   programs.&nbsp; Consider these diverse scholarship&nbsp;resources to illustrate   the wide range of interested entities that contribute to law enforcement   education.</p>
<h3>Office of the Police Corps*</h3>
<p><strong><em>*The&nbsp;following program description is for&nbsp;historical   reference only.&nbsp; Police officer recruitment efforts have slowed, so   Police Corps Scholarships are on hold.&nbsp; The program may or may-not be   funded again in the future.&nbsp; Interested applicants are encouraged to   contact the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.justice.gov/" target="_blank">U.S. Department of Justice</a> for developing information.</em></strong></p>
<p>A federal program designed to reduce violent crime by increasing the   number of skilled police officers working on community patrols across   the United States, the Police Corps offers scholarships worth up to   $3,750 per year to students who plan to earn their undergraduate   degrees, complete Police Corps training, and then serve for at least   four years in high need&nbsp;communities. Since&nbsp;Police Corps scholarships are   renewable, students&nbsp;receive a maximum of $15,000 from this program,   which may be used for tuition, fees, books, room, and board.</p>
<p>Men and women of all ages, races, and economic backgrounds are   encouraged to apply for the Police Corps Scholarship Program. Family   income is not considered, but all applicants must be enrolled as   full-time students.&nbsp; Community college students are eligible once they   have been accepted into&nbsp;four-year college programs.</p>
<h3>Wisconsin Professional Police Association</h3>
<p>Wisconsin residents who are pursuing&nbsp;law enforcement degrees at state   colleges and vocational schools are eligible for this state-specific   financial aid.&nbsp; Criminal justice, police science and other related law   enforcement programs that lead to two-year and four-year degrees are   supported by the <a href="http://www.wppa.com/resources/scholarship_program.htm" target="_blank">WPPA Scholarship Program</a>.&nbsp;Law school does not qualify. To be considered, students are required to submit:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Completed Application</li>
  <li>High School Transcript</li>
  <li>Three Letters of Recommendation</li>
  <li>200 Word Essay &ndash; <em>Why a Law Enforcement Career</em>?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Paralyzed and Disabled Police Officers Fund</h3>
<p>National Association of Chiefs of Police puts forth a Disabled Police Officers Fund <a href="http://www.aphf.org/scholardpof.pdf" target="_blank">Educational Scholarship</a> that supports higher education among members.&nbsp; Scholarships are worth   $500 each, and are renewed for four years of college.&nbsp; Disabled officers   and their sons and daughters are eligible to apply.&nbsp; Transcripts of   current students, SAT/ACT scores, and a GPA of 2.0 are prerequisites.</p>
<h3>Association of Certified Fraud Examiners</h3>
<p>Criminal justice students planning to pursue law enforcement careers specializing in fraud awareness are eligible for the <a href="http://www.acfechicago.org/Scholarships/Ritchie-Jennings_Memorial_Scholarship_Program/" target="_blank">Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship</a> from the <a href="http://www.acfe.com/" target="_blank">Association of Certified Fraud Examiners</a>.   The generous program dispenses one $10,000, two $5000, four $2500 and   23 $1000 scholarships annually, to current full-time undergraduate&nbsp;and   graduate students who demonstrate&nbsp;passion and aptitude for fraud-related   fields like business, criminal justice, accounting and finance.</p>
<p>Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) awards require   qualified candidates to submit&nbsp; completed applications, essays,   transcripts, and letters of recommendation.&nbsp; In addition to   Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarships, students-members are eligible   for ACFE Chapter Sponsored Scholarships.</p>
<h3>Women in Law Enforcement Scholarships</h3>
<p>Female college students pursuing careers in federal law enforcement are eligible to apply for scholarships awarded by <a href="http://www.wifle.org/scholarshipprogram.htm" target="_blank">Women in Federal Law Enforcement</a>,   a professional organization dedicated to promoting gender equity within   the field. Scholarships are valued at $2,000 each and may be renewed   according to the organization&rsquo;s future funding.</p>
<p>Women in Federal Law Enforcement Scholarships are awarded based on   each applicant&rsquo;s level&nbsp;of academic achievement, commitment to community   service, and exhibited professional law enforcement potential. Full-time   students majoring in criminal justice or related disciplines are   encouraged to apply.&nbsp;One year of completed college coursework, an essay,   transcripts, and letters of recommendation are prerequisites that must   be satisfied alongside completed applications.&nbsp; Some WIFLE&nbsp;Scholarships   are reserved for members in good standing. &nbsp;For additional gender-based   scholarships rewarding women, consult our <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/women.htm">Women&rsquo;s Scholarships Page</a>.</p>
<h3>National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.noblenational.org/" target="_blank">National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives</a>&nbsp;(NOBLE)   is committed to increasing the number of&nbsp;African American law   enforcement leaders. Black students who enter&nbsp;law enforcement   educational programs are supported by national and regional NOBLE   chapters across the United States.&nbsp; As part of the organization&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.noblenational.org/communityoutreach/noblescholarships.html" target="_blank">Community Outreach</a> effort, several annual&nbsp;memorial scholarships are awarded to promising   law enforcement students of African descent.&nbsp; Additional financial   resources for African Americans are outlined on this <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/resc_minority.html">Minority Scholarships Page</a>.</p>
