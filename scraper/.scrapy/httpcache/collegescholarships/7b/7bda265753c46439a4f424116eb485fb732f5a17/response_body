      <h2>  Going for the First Time or Coming Back?    </h2>
	  
<p>Non-traditional students fall outside of the preconceived norms for   college-bound students. General wisdom has it that high school graduates   who wish to pursue a college education do so directly after graduation,   completing a seamless transition into post-secondary education. But   there are many paths to higher education, and they do not all conform to   the same map. Many students choose to postpone college, or move   directly into the workforce bypassing a university education altogether.   It is only later that they decide to pursue a higher education, either   to improve their professional opportunities, or to expand their general   knowledge. Still other students may have had their college careers   interrupted, either by growing families or financial difficulties, and   only later return to complete what they had started.</p>
<p>Many non-traditional, or returning, students can feel left out of the   scholarship equation. However, there are many scholarships and grants   dedicated to helping the non-traditional student achieve his or her   educational goals. These scholarships are funded by a variety of   sources, including corporations, professional associations and colleges   and universities. Non-traditional students, and returning students   looking to finish an interrupted education, can find many lucrative   scholarship opportunities specifically designed for their situation.</p>

<h2>General Scholarships for Non-traditional Students</h2>
<p>More and more adult students are heading to college. The demands of a   competitive marketplace have made a college education vital to   advancement in many professions. These scholarships are supported by   professional associations, universities and advocacy groups.</p>
<p>The following examples of non-traditional scholarship opportunities   will give both new, and returning, students an idea of what is available   to those college-bound students who fit a different mold.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.alaforveterans.org/what_we_do/scholarships/Pages/Non-TraditionalStudentScholarship.aspx" target="_blank">American Legion Auxiliary Non-traditional Student Scholarship</a> &ndash; An annual award of $1000 is available to members of the American   Legion, the AL Auxiliary or the Sons of The American Legion. The   scholarship is open to adult students who are headed to college for the   first time, or are returning to complete an interrupted education.   Applicants must be enrolled in an accredited vocational school, or a   two-year or four-year college.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.act.org/walmart/associate/" target="_blank">Walmart Associate Scholarship</a> &ndash; Supported by the national retail chain, this scholarship provides   encouragement and financial aid for Walmart employees who are looking to   return to college to improve their career opportunities. The   scholarship is open to all employees with a high school diploma or GED.   Award amounts range from $500 to $1500 per degree course. Eligibility is   determined by financial need.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.antshe.org/scholarships" target="_blank">Association for Non-traditional Students in Higher Education</a> &ndash; ANTSHE is dedicated to the support and encouragement of adult   students who are pursuing their degrees in higher education. The   association administers three scholarship programs, the<strong><em> Marius &ldquo;Gabe&rdquo; Degabriel Scholarship</em></strong>, the <strong><em>Kazimour Scholarship</em></strong> and the<strong><em> Contributors Scholarship</em></strong>. Award amounts vary, depending on course of studies, academic achievement and financial need.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://osherfoundation.org/index.php?reentry" target="_blank">Osher Reentry Scholarship Program</a> &ndash; The Bernard Osher Foundation provides scholarships for returning   students whose college education has been interrupted for a minimum of   five years. Applicants must be between the ages of 25 &ndash; 50, and must be   attending a cooperating college or university. Award amounts vary, and   are determined by financial need.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://ewiconnect.com/ewiconnect/Community/EWI_Scholarships_ASIST.aspx" target="_blank">Adult Students in Scholastic Transition Scholarship</a> &ndash; The ASIST program is supported by Executive Women International, and   is available to all adult learners who are returning to college for   educational training to improve their career opportunities. Applicants   may be single parents, displaced homemakers, or individuals entering the   workforce for the first time. 150 scholarships are awarded annually,   ranging from $1000 &ndash; $2500.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Scholarships for Single Parents</h2>
<p>Single parents account for a large proportion of non-traditional   students. In an effort to improve life for themselves and their   children, single parents often return to college for specific   educational training that will make them more valuable in a crowded   workforce. Completing a college education gives single parents greater   career opportunities, and consequently provides a more stable and secure   home life for their families.</p>
<p>Many professional associations, corporations and local governments   sponsor scholarships for single parents who are heading to college as a   way to improve the future prospects of their families.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.scholarship.org/index.php?submenu=Scholarships&amp;src=gendocs&amp;link=Scholarships" target="_blank">George Snow Scholarship Fund</a> provides scholarships for single parents who are returning to college   to complete courses that will move them forward in the workplace. These   are regional scholarships available to students in the Palm Beach and   Broward counties of Florida. Award amounts vary, depending on the   student&rsquo;s status, and the availability of funds. Students must be   enrolled at a cooperating state college or university.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://scholarships.hispanicfund.org/applications/subsectionID.1,pageID.206/default.asp" target="_blank">Denny&rsquo;s Single Parent Student Scholarship</a> is designed to support the college ambitions of Denny&rsquo;s employees with   an Hispanic background. The scholarship is open to all employees of the   food chain, regardless of age, who are single a parents. Applicants must   be enrolled in an accredited college or university, and must maintain a   minimum 3.0 GPA. Award amounts range from $500 to $1500.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.aspsf.org/students_spscholarships.html" target="_blank">Arkansas Single Parent Scholarship</a> provides scholarship assistance to single parents attending college in   the state of Arkansas. Award amounts are determined by financial need.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Scholarships for Women</strong></h2>
<p>A large percentage of so-called non-traditional students are women.   Many women put their college careers on hold, choosing the much more   difficult task of raising a family. Often, as children grow and family   conditions change, women make the decision to return to college. They   may be preparing to enter the workforce for the first time, or are eager   to advance their career through additional education and training. Many   scholarships specifically target both traditional, and non-traditional,   female students. These scholarship programs may be sponsored by   professional associations, corporations or women&rsquo;s advocacy groups.<img src="https://www.collegescholarships.org/images/single-mom-college-grants.jpg" width="283" height="424" alt="single parent scholarships" class="alignright" /></p>
<p>The following examples will provide a brief overview of what may be available to non-traditional female students.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.wispinc.org/Programs/WISP/tabid/62/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Women&rsquo;s Independence Scholarship Program</a> provides encouragement and financial support for survivors of spousal   abuse. The object of the scholarship is to help survivors of abuse   obtain the education they need to secure employment, independence and   self sufficiency. Scholarships may be applied to state supported   community universities, vocational schools or private colleges. Award   amounts vary according to financial need.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://rankinfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Jeanette Rankin Women&rsquo;s Scholarship Fund</a> is dedicated to low income women 35 years of age,&nbsp; or older, who are   working to secure meaningful careers and break the cycle of poverty.   Named in honor of the first woman to be elected to the U.S. Congress,   the scholarship helps low income women attain their educational goals.   Award amounts vary, are based on financial need.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.lindalaelmiller.com/lindas-scholarship/" target="_blank">Linda Lael Miller Scholarship for Women</a> is aimed at female students aged 25 years or older. The purpose of the   scholarship is to help women obtain the education they need to succeed   in a male dominated competitive marketplace. Special attention is given   to single parents, survivors of domestic violence and students with   disabilities. $10,000 in annual scholarship awards are divided between   the successful applicants.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thetalbotsinc.com/brands/talbots/charitable/scholar.asp" target="_blank">Talbots Women&rsquo;s Scholarship Fund</a>&nbsp;   provides scholarships for women who are returning to college to secure a   professional degree. Applicants must have graduated high school, or   earned their GED, no less than 10 years previous to applying for the   award. Six $10,000, and 60 $1000, scholarships are awarded annually.</li>
  <li><a href="http://possiblewomanfoundationinternational.org/foundation-news/possible-woman-foundation-international-gives-five-scholarships/" target="_blank">Possible Woman Foundation International</a> supports five annual scholarships for women who are returning to school   after an extended absence, with the intent of starting a new career or   advancing in their current profession. Award amounts are supported by   private donations, and are determined financial need, and by the   availability of funds.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are only a few of the available scholarship programs designed   to encourage and support the non-traditional student. As more and more   adults are returning to college to improve their career opportunities,   so more and more financial aid programs are being designed to address   their needs. Non-traditional students are encouraged to contact the   financial aid offices at the college of their choice for information on   further scholarship programs which may be supported by their own   college, university or technical school.</p>
<p>Non-traditional students looking to fund their college education are also encouraged to consult our section on <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/grants/non-traditional.htm">Grants for Non-traditional Students</a> for more sources of financial aid.</p>
