<h2>Get Well-Deserved Funds from Gov&rsquo;t and Military</h2>

<p>Military servicemen and women make extraordinary sacrifices in the   service of their country. While nothing can truly repay that service,   the military establishment and the Federal government have made it a   priority to help the dependents of service personnel gain greater access   to a college education. Valuable scholarships are supported by every   branch of the military for the spouses and children of active-duty and   retired personnel. Additional scholarship programs are dedicated to the   dependents of military personnel who have been disabled or given their   lives in the service of their country. These scholarship programs   provide much needed financial assistance to the families of those men   and women who have sacrificed so much in the defense of our freedom.</p>

<h2>State Supported Scholarships for Military Dependents</h2>
<p>Many state governments offer valuable scholarships and grants for   military personnel and their families. These programs are usually   administered through the state&rsquo;s Department of Higher Education and the   Office of Veterans Affairs. The availability of these programs will vary   widely from state to state. Veterans and/or their dependents should   contact their states Department of Higher Education, or Office of   Veterans Affairs, for details on financial aid programs for which they   may be eligible.</p>
<p>The following examples will give students an idea of the types of programs that are available at the state level.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="https://va.iowa.gov/benefits/war_orphans.html" target="_blank">Iowa War Orphans Educational Aid</a> provides financial aid to the children of military personnel who have   been killed in combat. Award amounts may not exceed $600 per academic   year, and there is a $3000 lifetime limit on assistance.</li>

The fund also   provides scholarships for the children of combat service personnel who   have been declared missing in action, or who are being held as prisoners   of war. The Freedom Alliance Scholarships are available to students in   various states across the country.</li>
  <li><a href="http://montanadma.org/" target="_blank">Montana&rsquo;s Department of Military Affairs</a> administers a number of programs for service-members and their families. Current programs include <strong><em>Scholarships for the Dependents of POW/MIA&rsquo;s</em></strong> and <strong><em>Scholarships for the Children of Deceased Veterans</em></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with all state-based financial aid, award amounts vary according   to available funds. Students are encouraged to contact their state&rsquo;s   Department of Higher Education, and Office of Veterans Affairs, for more   information on scholarships and grants designed to support the college   ambitions of military dependents.</p>
<p>Scholarships and grants for the dependents of military personnel are a   small offering of thanks for the sacrifice made by our intrepid men and   women in uniform. If you are the child or spouse of a military service   member, you may be able to take advantage of a wide range of financial   aid opportunities available to help you achieve your college goals.</p>
