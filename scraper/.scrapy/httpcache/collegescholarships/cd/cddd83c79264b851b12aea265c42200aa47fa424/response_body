      <h2>  Get a Financial Break in College   </h2>
	  
<p>All college-bound students face challenges, but none more than those   students struggling to overcome a life-threatening disease. A cancer   diagnosis can have devastating effects on a student and their family.   Beyond the physical stresses of fighting the disease, there is an   accompanying emotional stress and depression that can derail a promising   academic career. </p>
<p>Students fighting cancer can sometimes feel that there   is little point in continuing their education. Moreover, the high costs   of cancer treatment only serve to reinforce the idea that college is no   longer a possibility, let alone a priority. But nothing could be   further from the truth. <img src="https://www.collegescholarships.org/images/cancer-scholarships.jpg" class="alignright" width="400" height="300" alt="cancer scholarships" /></p>
<p>The emotional and psychological benefits of   pursuing a personal ambition can have a profound effect on a patient&rsquo;s   recovery. As for funding, there are a wide range of organizations and   advocacy groups dedicated to helping cancer patients, and cancer   survivors, afford a college education. These organizations routinely   sponsor scholarships designed to help cancer patients and their families   find the funds they need to continue their college education.</p>
<h2>Federal Sources of Cancer Scholarships</h2>
<p>While there are no actual Federally funded scholarships for cancer   survivors, there are a number of general grants that are open to all   students. These are need-based grants, and the financial burden placed   on cancer patients and their families is likely to make them eligible   for an award.</p>
<p>Cancer patients who are searching for financial assistance to help   them meet the costs of tuition should begin with the following Federal   programs.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://studentaid.ed.gov/types/grants-scholarships/pell" target="_blank">Federal Pell Grant</a> &ndash; This program is open to undergraduate students who are pursuing their   first associate&rsquo;s or bachelor&rsquo;s degree. Awards are determined according   to financial need. The maximum annual award is $5,550.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://studentaid.ed.gov/types/grants-scholarships/FSEOG" target="_blank">Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant</a> &ndash; The FSEOG is available to students who have qualified for a Pell   grant, but are still left with considerable unmet need. The FSEOG   program is administered through the financial aid offices of   participating colleges and universities, and students should apply   through their school of choice. Awards range from $100 to $4000.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Private Sources of Scholarships</h2>
<p>The majority of scholarships for cancer patients and survivors are   funded by the private sector. Professional associations and advocacy and   support groups are the primary source of financial assistance for   students who are pursuing their college education while battling or   recovering from all types of cancer. Students looking for cancer related   scholarships should begin their search by looking for organizations and   support groups linked to their type of cancer. For example, a student   who has been diagnosed with breast cancer will want to concentrate on   organizations that support the needs of breast cancer survivors and   their families.</p>
<p>Scholarships for cancer patients and survivors are dependent upon   private and corporate donations. The availability of programs, and award   amounts, are subject to change according to current funding. The   following programs are examples of the types of scholarships available   for college-bound students who are battling cancer.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.cancerforcollege.org/" target="_blank">Cancer for College</a> was founded in 1993 by Craig Pollard. The organization offers a number   of annual scholarships, ranging from $250 to $4000, for cancer patients   and cancer survivors. The organizations is based out of California, and   primary consideration is given to applicants from within the state.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.cancersurvivorsfund.org/" target="_blank">Cancer Survivors Fund</a> is a non-profit charitable foundation dedicated to helping cancer   survivors find the money they need to complete a college education. The   fund sponsors four annual scholarships for cancer survivors. To be   eligible, applicants must be a cancer survivor, or currently diagnosed   with cancer, and must be enrolled in an accredited college or   university. Applicants must submit an essay describing their cancer   experience, along with a complete medical history. Award amounts vary,   and are determined on the basis of personal hardship and financial need.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://milesofhope.org/" target="_blank">Miles of Hope Breast Cancer Foundation</a> is a leading charitable organization and support group in the New York   Hudson Bay area. The foundation offers peer to peer counseling, outreach   programs, and financial assistance for breast cancer patients and their   families. The foundation also awards eight $1000 scholarships every   year to students whose lives have been affected by breast cancer.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.patientadvocate.org/index.php" target="_blank">Patient Advocate Foundation</a> sponsors the <a href="http://www.patientadvocate.org/help.php?p=69" target="_blank">PAF Scholarship for Survivors</a>.   The program is dedicated to providing scholarships to students who have   suffered, or are suffering, a life threatening disease. Applicants must   be under the age of 25, must submit two letters of recommendation, must   provide a detailed medical history, and must be enrolled full time at   an accredited college or university. Recipients of the scholarship must   agree to complete 20 hours of community service for each year the   scholarship is awarded. The annual award amount currently stands at   $3000.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.cancer.org/index" target="_blank">American Cancer Society</a> is one of the largest and must successful advocacy groups in the United States. ACS administers the <a href="http://www.cancer.org/myacs/ohio/programsandservices/ohio-college-scholarship" target="_blank">Youth Cancer Survivor College Scholarship</a> for students under the age of 25 who were diagnosed with cancer prior to their 21st birthday. The maximum annual award amounts is $1000.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Students Affected by Cancer</h2>
<p>Families of cancer patients face their own challenges.   Understandably, the concern for the child or sibling is paramount, and   all attention is directed towards their battle with this   life-threatening disease. But cancer can derail an entire family&rsquo;s   future, and the extended treatments can quickly deplete a family&rsquo;s   savings. Consequently, many family members may have to defer their   college education indefinitely due to lack of financing.</p>
<p>Many charitable foundations and advocacy groups understand that a   diagnosis of cancer effects more than just the patient, and have   developed a number of scholarships designed to help the family members   of cancer patients to continue their college education. These programs   are designed to address the specific needs of the children and siblings   of cancer patients by providing financial assistance to help them meet   the costs of a college tuition.</p>
<p>The following programs are examples of the type of scholarships available for family members of cancer patients and survivors.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.supersibs.org/" target="_blank">SuperSibs!</a> is an advocacy group dedicated to the needs of the brothers and sisters of cancer patients. The <a href="http://www.supersibs.org/what-we-do/scholarship/" target="_blank">SuperSibs! Scholarship Program</a> is open to graduating high school seniors who are the sibling of a   cancer patient or cancer survivor. Applicants must have a minimum 2.0   GPA, and must be preparing to enroll in a four-year accredited college   or university. Award amounts vary.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://melfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Mary Ellen Locher Foundation</a> provides scholarships to the children of breast cancer patients.   Applicants must have a high school diploma or GED, and must be enrolled   full-time at an accredited two-year of four-year college or university.   Award amounts vary, and are determined on the basis of academic   achievement, community service and financial need.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.ulmanfund.org/Home.aspx" target="_blank">Ulman Cancer Fund for Young Adults</a> sponsors an annual scholarship for college-bound students affected by   cancer, either through their own diagnosis or the diagnosis of a family   member. Applicants must have been 15 years of older when their parent or   sibling was taking treatments for cancer. Recipients must agree to   perform 40 hours of community service related to cancer awareness. The   award is valued at $2500.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://inheritanceofhope.org/component/content/article/461.html" target="_blank">Inheritance of Hope Scholarship</a> is available to college-bound high school seniors with a parent who has   been diagnosed with terminal cancer. Applicants must submit a video   essay on their family&rsquo;s cancer experience, and must provide a medical   history of their terminally ill parent. The scholarship provides a one   time award of $1000.</li>
</ul>
<p>A diagnosis of cancer, either for a student or for a family member,   can easily interrupt a promising college career. But with the help of   charitable foundations and advocacy groups that doesn&rsquo;t always need to   be the case. These organizations work hard to help students and families   cope with the fight against cancer, both financially and emotionally.   Cancer is a frightening disease, and while it may alter the course of a   person&rsquo;s life it does not have to totally derail it. Scholarships for   cancer patients, their children and their siblings, can help to keep a   student&rsquo;s life on track.</p>
