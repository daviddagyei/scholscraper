      <h2> Too Poor for College?     </h2>
	  
<p>Thomas Jefferson wrote 100 years ago,&nbsp;&rdquo;..that the children of the   poor must be thus educated at common expense.&rdquo; Today, grants and   scholarships open doors for students from low-income families, by   providing financial aid for those who need it most.</p>
<p>Academic high-achievers who&nbsp;need money for college enjoy access to a   wide variety of merit-based awards that take financial conditions into   account.&nbsp; For good students, economic disadvantages can be overcome with   the help of low-income college scholarships.</p>
<p>Scholarships originate from many sources, and each has its own unique   eligibility requirements.&nbsp; Your school&rsquo;s financial aid office has the   most&nbsp;up to date information about current low-income scholarship   opportunities.&nbsp; These examples illustrate the wide scope of entities   willing to help you pay for college.</p>
<p><strong>Unmet Need Scholarship Program</strong></p>
<p>As a part of the Sallie Mae Scholarship Fund, the <a href="http://www.thesalliemaefund.org/smfnew/scholarship/Unmet_need.html" target="_blank">Unmet Need Scholarship Program</a>&nbsp;provides   low income families with coveted college cash.&nbsp; Eligibility is limited   to families with a combined annual&nbsp;income of less than $30,000.&nbsp;   Scholarships range from $1,000 to $3,000 each, and are designed as   supplemental scholarships that fill&nbsp;&rdquo;unmet&rdquo; financial aid need of $1,000   or more.&nbsp;&nbsp; U.S. citizens, enrolled full-time as&nbsp; undergraduates   at&nbsp;accredited colleges or universities, and having grade point averages   of at least 2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;(or&nbsp;GED average test scores&nbsp; between 42 and 52) are   invited to apply.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.collegescholarships.org/images/low-income-scholarships.jpg" width="412" height="291" alt="low income scholarships for college" class="aligncenter" /></p>
<p><strong>National Medical Fellowships Need Based Scholarship Program</strong></p>
<p>This <a href="http://www.nmfonline.org/" target="_blank">Need Based Scholarship Program</a> is open to first and second year medical students who&nbsp;demonstrate&nbsp;   significant financial aid needs.&nbsp;&nbsp; The mission of the program is to   increase health care access and awareness among low-income communities,   and to increase the role of under-represented minorities in medical   fields.&nbsp; Since 1946, over 30,000 scholarship recipients have benefited   to the tune of&nbsp;over $40 million. The scholarships&nbsp;range from $500 to   $10,000 each, with priority consideration being given to those   applicants exhibiting the&nbsp;greatest levels of financial need.&nbsp; The   organization also administers merit-based scholarships for third and   fourth-year minority students who&nbsp;are recognized as scholastic   high-achievers.</p>
<p><strong>ABA Legal Opportunity Scholarship Fund</strong></p>
<p>The American Bar Association promotes diversity within the legal profession through its <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/groups/diversity/diversity_pipeline/projects_initiatives/legal_opportunity_scholarship.html" target="_blank">Legal Opportunity Scholarship Fund</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Needy   students attending&nbsp;ABA accredited law schools are eligible for   scholarships worth $15,000 over the three-year course of law school   education.&nbsp;Over 1000 applicants compete for 20 annual awards, which each   apply to law school tuition expenses at one of the 50 participating   schools.&nbsp; Since its inception, the fund has assisted over 200&nbsp;low-income   and minority law school students.</p>
<p><strong>Gates Millennium Scholars</strong></p>
<p>Funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gmsp.org/" target="_blank">Gates Millennium Scholarships</a>&nbsp;reduce   financial hardship for low-income minority families preparing to send   members to college. African Americans, Hispanics, Native   Americans/Alaskan Natives, and Asian Pacific Islanders are invited to   apply for&nbsp;one of the 1000 annual Millennium Scholarships, each of which   provides a full financial ride through graduation.</p>
<p>Candidates&nbsp;must be legal residents of the U.S. with cumulative   high-school GPA of at least 3.3.&nbsp; Additionally, diverse applicants must   be entering&nbsp;full-time programs at accredited colleges or universities.&nbsp;   Disadvantaged students must show economic hardship to warrant   consideration for the awards, and must also exhibit&nbsp;leadership skills   through participation in extracurricular activities. Federal<a href="http://www2.ed.gov/programs/fpg/index.html" target="_blank"> Pell Grant </a>eligibility is also a prerequisite.</p>
<p>Each applicant must be&nbsp;nominated &nbsp;for a Gates Scholarship, by a   teacher or administrator who is familiar with the student&rsquo;s academic   record.&nbsp; A recommendation which attests to the student&rsquo;s extracurricular   participation and exemplary leadership qualities is also required.</p>
<p>In addition to monetary aid, Gates Scholars are nurtured with   academic support during school, as well as access to professional   development opportunities through millennium Foundation leadership   programs.</p>
<p>Students who complete an undergraduate degree program may&nbsp;request   additional scholarship funding for graduate studies in the specific   areas of education, engineering, library science, mathematics, public   health and computer science.</p>
<p><strong>The Google Scholarship Program</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/jobs/students/proscho/scholarships/#src=scholarships" target="_blank">Google Scholarship Program</a>&nbsp;encompasses   a variety of financial aid offerings that further higher education   among under-represented groups.&nbsp; to recruit top talent&nbsp;to business&nbsp;and   technology careers, Google steers student aid to low-income students and   other minority groups.</p>
<p>Some current Google awards and the groups they serve:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/anitaborg/" target="_blank">Anita Borg Memorial Scholarship</a> &ndash; This focused scholarship targets women pursuing degrees in computer   science disciplines.&nbsp; Applicants from The United States and Canada   compete for funds that are awarded based on academic achievement and   leadership potential.&nbsp; Winners are also invited to a retreat at Google,   where they engage with their peers in networking environments and   participate in career development activities sponsored by the company.</p>
<p>American Indian Science and Engineering Society (<a href="http://aises.org/what/programs/scholarships/info/googlescholars" target="_blank">AISES</a>)   partners with Google to administer a scholarship worth $10, 000   to&nbsp;American Indians aspiring to enter computer related fields.&nbsp;   Applicants must be full-time students pursuing degrees in computer   science or computer engineering.&nbsp; A 3.0 GPA is required, as well as   sophomore status.&nbsp; Candidates are drawn from AISES membership, and must   also be members of&nbsp;Indian tribes.</p>
<p><a href="http://hispanicfund.org/programs/college/scholarships/google-scholarship-program" target="_blank">Hispanic Scholarship Fund</a>&nbsp;works   with Google and other sponsors, to promote Latino educational causes in   the U.S.&nbsp; Hispanic applicants who are juniors and seniors at accredited   universities compete for scholarships worth 10K each, and trips to the   Google conference retreat at company headquarters.&nbsp; Candidates exhibit   financial need and good grades, including 3.0 GPA and continued progress   toward college degrees.&nbsp; Low-income winners who are pursuing computer   science and computer engineering degrees also receive academic   counselling and career development training.</p>
<p><strong>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Scholarship Program</strong></p>
<p>In conjunction with the <a href="http://www.uncf.org/sections/ForStudents/SS_Scholarships/scholarships.asp" target="_blank">United Negro College Fund</a> (UNCF), Abercrombie &amp; Fitch&nbsp;provides a scholarship program&nbsp;for   African American students from low income families. The scholarships are   valued&nbsp;at $3,000 each, for first year students enrolled&nbsp;at four-year   universities.</p>
<p>Diversity scholarships often contain financial eligibility   requirements.&nbsp; If you are a minority student experiencing financial   hardship, some scholarships are aimed directly at you.&nbsp; In addition to   the A&amp;F Scholarship, UNCF administers&nbsp;programs sponsored by   corporations and private benefactors.&nbsp; Current offerings include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Anheuser-Busch Legends of the Crown Scholarships</li>
  <li>Hallmark/UNCF Scholars</li>
  <li>Detroit Student Aid Scholarship</li>
  <li>Edna Blum Scholarship</li>
  <li>Marathon Oil Scholarship</li>

</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.collegescholarships.org/images/currencies.jpg" width="200" height="199" alt="currencies" class="alignright" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.imagine-america.org/scholarships-education" target="_blank">Imagine America Foundation</a>&nbsp;sponsors three career-oriented college scholarships:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Image America for high school seniors has helped thousands of career   college students since its 1998 inception.&nbsp; Online applicants are each   eligible for an award totalling $1000.&nbsp; The Foundation works with   guidance counselors across the country to place money in the hands of   students attending any of the 500 participating career schools.</li>
  <li>Military Award Program (MAP) for military personnel was founded in   2004 to help veterans and military personnel make the transition to   civilian life.&nbsp; Active-duty, retired and reserve personnel are eligible   for $1000 awards earmarked for career college education.</li>
  <li>Adult Skills Education Program (ASEP) supports non-traditional   career college students with one-time grants for school.&nbsp; Each applicant   must complete a student assessment to be considered for the award.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.jkcf.org/scholarships" target="_blank">Jack Kent Cooke Foundation</a>&nbsp;distributes   a series of educational scholarships for secondary school students,   undergraduates and graduate students.&nbsp; The scholarships reward students   from low-income families who exhibit hard work and a strong will to   succeed.&nbsp; Financial need is a prerequisite for all of the Foundation&rsquo;s   awards, along with solid academic achievement and extracurricular   participation.&nbsp; JKC scholarships address three distinct groups of   students, from middle school through post-graduate studies.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.jkcf.org/scholarships/young-scholars-program/" target="_blank">Young Scholars Program</a> &ndash; Early intervention is the driving force behind these scholarships   that&nbsp;nurture high-achievers from an early age, to increase positive   outcomes for low-income students.&nbsp; Candidates apply in 7th grade, and   enter the program beginning in 8th grade.&nbsp; Winners receive custom   tailored assistance, which provides support for summer school, distance   learning, music, art and other instruction.&nbsp; Most recipients remain in   public schools, but the program also accommodates students who need   private school education.&nbsp;Sixty winners are chosen from thousands of   applicants each year, most of them drawn from families with annual   incomes around $25,000.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.jkcf.org/scholarships/undergraduate-transfer-scholarships/" target="_blank">Undergraduate Transfer Student Scholarships </a>-   The generous compensation put forth by this transfer program makes it   the country&rsquo;s largest initiative of its kind.&nbsp; Community college   students receive up to $30,000 each, to be used to ease the financial   transition into 4-year bachelor&rsquo;s degree programs.&nbsp; Sixty deserving   winners enter the program each year, receiving scholarships designed to   cover tuition, living expenses, books and other fees.&nbsp; Each eligible   candidate&nbsp;must be&nbsp;recommended by the JKC Faculty Representative from his   or her 2-year school.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.jkcf.org/scholarships/graduate-scholarships/" target="_blank">Graduate Scholarships</a>&nbsp;- JKC Graduate Scholarships reflect 3 specific award types.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li>Graduate Arts Awards are for needy students pursuing post-graduate   work in visual arts, performance arts and creative writing.&nbsp; Winners are   eligible for up to $50,000 for each of three years.</li>
  <li>Dissertation Fellowships support students who are engaged in   graduate-level work that specifically strives to illuminate   understanding of the educational paths of low-income high-achievers.&nbsp;   Academic ability and unmet financial need are key requisites for this   scholarship.</li>
  <li>General Graduate Scholarships are now offered exclusively to past   JKC undergraduate scholarship winners.&nbsp; Due to budget constraints, only   JKC scholars are available to receive one-time awards of 50K, to be   applied to graduate school tuition and fees.</li>
