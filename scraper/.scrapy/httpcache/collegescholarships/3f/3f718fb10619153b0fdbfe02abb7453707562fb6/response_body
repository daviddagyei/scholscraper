      <h2>  'Checkup' on Opportunites for Every Level of Medical Education   </h2>
	  
<p>Embarking on a medical career requires a considerable financial   commitment &ndash; from the&nbsp;word go.&nbsp; Undergraduate tuition bills are enough   to stymie many families&rsquo; educational funding efforts,&nbsp;so additional   schooling at the graduate and <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/doctoral-students.htm">doctoral levels </a>can   be devastating to the bottom line.&nbsp; The average medical school graduate   leaves college with over $150,000 in student debt &ndash; and the figure   keeps rising.</p>
<p>Medical school assistance falls into largely the same categories as the financial aid that carried you through your <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/undergraduate-students.htm">undergraduate courses</a>.&nbsp;   Government agencies, individual colleges, and private entities each put   forth educational funding for cash strapped medical college students.&nbsp;   Various forms of aid, including <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/grants/">grants</a>,   service scholarships and medical student loans are tapped to bridge the   gap between medical tuition costs and student resources.</p>
<p>Resourcefulness and perseverance yield medical school financial aid   that supports your under-funded advanced degree pursuits.&nbsp; One of the   best ways to pay for medical school is to get good grades.&nbsp; Students who   consistently excel academically open merit-based scholarship doors for   funding medical school education.<img src="https://www.collegescholarships.org/images/med-school-scholarships.jpg" width="283" height="424" alt="Med school scholarships" class="alignright" /></p>
<h2>Merit Scholarships</h2>
<p>Medical schools that offer scholarships are looking for committed and   talented candidates, so most awards are issued based on merit. In   scholarship funding, merit is defined as&nbsp;maintaining&nbsp;rigorous academic   standards; including a &nbsp;high grade point average (GPA)&nbsp;throughout high   school and&nbsp;baccalaureate studies, and scoring&nbsp;highly on the <a href="https://www.aamc.org/students/applying/mcat/" target="_blank">Medical College Admissions Test</a> (MCAT).&nbsp;Medical schools offer merit-based scholarships according to   their own particular rules, so students are encouraged to consult   with&nbsp;medical school advisers at individual campuses.</p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.mayo.edu/mms/" target="_blank">Mayo Medical School</a>,   in Minnesota, offers three types of scholarships to high achieving   applicants. Medical students submit completed applications to start the   review process, which includes interviews and extensive student vetting.   These competitive scholarships provide valuable performance-based   resources:</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Merit scholarships</strong> offer&nbsp;fifty percent tuition reimbursement and are renewable based on academic performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Dean&rsquo;s awards</strong> are full&nbsp;ride scholarships that go to medical students who show commitment and potential in medical education.</li>
    <li><strong>Outstanding achievement scholarships</strong> are   distributed to student applicants that come from non-traditional   backgrounds and have overcome adversity to excel in medical education.   These scholarships are renewable based on continued academic excellence.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>The University of Miami&nbsp; &ndash; <a href="http://www.med.miami.edu/" target="_blank">Miller School of Medicine</a> awards several million dollars worth of direct individual   scholarships&nbsp;each year. Once students are accepted into the school, they   are automatically&nbsp;considered for&nbsp;scholarships.&nbsp; Selection criteria   include submitted transcripts, test scores and levels of financial   need.&nbsp;Students with high GPAs and high MCAT scores are given priority   consideration for receiving campus-based funding.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Armed Forces Medical Training Opportunities</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.med.navy.mil/sites/navmedmpte/accessions/pages/healthprofessionsscholarshipprogram_prospective.aspx" target="_blank">Health Professions Scholarship Program</a> (HPSP) is a military benefit offered by the United States Army, Air   Force and Navy. The United State Marine Corps does not offer HPSP   because&nbsp;<a href="http://www.marines.mil/" target="_blank">Marines</a> receive their medical support from the Navy.</p>
<p>Under the program, the military pays for medical schooling, which   includes tuition, books and other fees. Medical students in the HPSP   also receive&nbsp;small remunerations each month to defray living expenses.   In return, students must serve a year for year match in terms of&nbsp;reserve   duty. Students are allowed to attend the medical schools of   their&nbsp;choices, but it is important to note that each applicant must be   accepted by&nbsp;an accredited&nbsp;medical school prior to requesting HPSP   participation. The military does not help students get admitted.</p>
<p>Accepted students&nbsp;are commissioned as&nbsp;inactive reservists during   their medical studies; however, they are required to participate in   forty-five days of active duty each year as a required component of   their participation. Upon graduation, students&nbsp;apply for medical   residency through a military match program, before having their ranks   raised to officer status. Typically this residency is served in a   military hospital, although in some special instances civilian hospitals   are utilized for training under the HPSP.</p>
<p>Upon&nbsp;completion of his or her residency, each successful participant   owes the military four years of active duty service.&nbsp; After serving a   four-year stint, a&nbsp;doctor can either continue a military career or serve   in the civilian sector. If&nbsp;civilian&nbsp;life is chosen, the doctor remains   committed for four additional years of reservist duty.</p>
<h2>Medical Association Scholarships</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/home.page?" target="_blank">American Medical Association</a> (AMA) Foundation recognizes the extraordinary financial needs of   medical students. In response to the financial shortcomings faced by a   majority of aspiring medical professionals,the Foundation issues <a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/education-careers/becoming-physician/ama-financial-aid.page" target="_blank">several scholarships</a> each year. To apply,&nbsp;students are encouraged to consult with program   administrators and&nbsp;financial aid representatives from individual   institutions of higher learning.&nbsp; Nominations and application forms may   have campus-specific components.&nbsp; These AMA resources support   educational funding for qualified candidates within the medical   education system:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/about-ama/ama-foundation/our-programs/medical-education/arthur-n-wilson.page" target="_blank">Minority Scholars Award</a> &ndash; Eligible students are in their second or third year of medical school   and have minority heritage. Ten scholarships worth $10,000 each are   awarded annually.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/about-ama/ama-foundation/our-programs/medical-education/arthur-n-wilson.page" target="_blank">Arthur Wilson, MD Scholarships</a> target rural access to health care.&nbsp; The annual awards go to medical   students who graduated from high school in Southeast Alaska.&nbsp; Because   the region faces infrastructure challenges connecting with the rest of   the world, the Wilson Scholarship serves as an important reminder about   the importance of medical education in under-served areas.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/about-ama/ama-foundation/our-programs/medical-education/scholars-fund.page?" target="_blank">Alliance Grassroots Honor Fund</a> replaces the longstanding Scholars Fund arm of the AMA.&nbsp; The   organization remains committed to honoring medical education with   targeted grants and scholarships&nbsp;that address the needs of women and   children.</li>
  <li>Public Health students benefit from the AMA&rsquo;s Women&rsquo;s Physicians Congress <a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/about-ama/ama-foundation/our-programs/public-health/joan-f-giambalvo.page?" target="_blank">Joan Giambalvo Memorial Scholarship Award</a>&nbsp;for women pursuing educational credentials in medical fields.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/about-ama/ama-foundation/our-programs/medical-education/physicians-tomorrow-scholarships.page" target="_blank">Physicians of Tomorrow</a> &ndash; A minimum of two scholarships are awarded annually, depending on   available funding.&nbsp; Third year students are invited to apply for awards   that are issued based on academic excellence and financial need.&nbsp; In   addition to general scholarships, some opportunities within the program   are geared toward specialty education in fields like psychiatry&nbsp;and   medical journalism.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Service-Oriented Scholarship Programs</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://nhsc.hrsa.gov/" target="_blank">National Health Service Corps</a> (NHSC) offers a scholarship program that pays for&nbsp;medical school   expenses &ndash; including a&nbsp;monthly living allowance stipend. Each eligible   student must gain admittance to a medical school on his or her own   merits, and be a United States citizen.&nbsp;In addition, scholarship   recipients must commit to work&nbsp;for periods of two to four years   in&nbsp;under-served medical-shortage areas.</p>
<p>Qualified applicants are pursuing medical degrees in primary care   disciplines.&nbsp; Upon graduation, or satisfaction of residency training,   part of the NHSC commitment requires scholarship participants to   practice medicine in areas that exhibit the greatest levels of need.</p>
