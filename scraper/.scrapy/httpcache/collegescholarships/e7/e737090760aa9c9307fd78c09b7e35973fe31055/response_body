      <h2> Scholarship and Grant Options    </h2>
	  
<p>Like other educational pursuits, religious studies have the potential to strain <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/loans/average-debt.htm">student budgets</a>.&nbsp;   Seminaries and&nbsp;college campuses engaged in training religious   professionals are in the business of matching prospective ministers with   the financial resources required to train them.&nbsp; If you plan to work in   a church ministry or attend seminary after college, take advantage of   the&nbsp;&nbsp;financial helping hands available at all<a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/degree-level.htm"> educational levels</a>.</p>
<p>Faith-based foundations and memorial funds provide college aid that   can be applied to a wide variety of degree pursuits.&nbsp;&nbsp;Theology   fellowships and other aid funded by churches should not be overlooked as   valuable financial aid resources.&nbsp; Use your faith, volunteerism and   other personal qualities to open educational doors within religious   disciplines.</p>
<h2>Theology Foundations and Trusts<img src="https://www.collegescholarships.org/images/religion-scholoarships.jpg" width="344" class="alignright" height="349" alt="religion scholarships" /></h2>
<p>The <a href="http://bivinsfoundations.org/scholarships" target="_blank">Mary E. Bivins Foundation Religious Scholarship Program</a>&nbsp;serves   students seeking&nbsp;undergraduate or graduate degrees that will prepare   them to serve as Christian ministers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To qualify, graduate students   must maintain grade point averages of at least 3.0, while undergrads&nbsp;are   held to a&nbsp;2.75 or higher standard.</p>
<p>The scholarships are valued at $2500 per semester for students   pursuing bachelor&rsquo;s degrees, and $3500 per semester for graduate level   studies.&nbsp;&nbsp; Graduate students must complete 9 credit hours, and   undergraduates 12, before applying to become <a href="https://www.grantrequest.com/SID_969/Default.asp?CT=CT&amp;SA=SNA&amp;FID=35017&amp;SESID=16587&amp;RL=" target="_blank">Bivins Scholars</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.abc-ohio.org/index.php/menu-obes" target="_blank">Ohio Baptist Education Society</a>&nbsp;stands   committed to advancing baptist theological education within the state.   To prepare well-educated professional baptist ministers, the   organization distributes financial aid from these four distinct   scholarship funds to worthy student ministers annually:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ohio Baptist Education Scholarship &ndash; Established 1831</li>
  <li>Faye and Robert Let Scholarship (African-American) &ndash; Established 1990</li>
  <li>Rev Dr. Ralph and Joyce Lamb Memorial Scholarship &ndash; Established 2002</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.abc-ohio.org/index.php/menu-obes/121-ernst-scholarship" target="_blank">Reverend Robert E. and Gladys Ersnt Scholarship</a> &ndash; Established 2007</li>
</ul>
<p>To be considered for any of the OPES Scholarship programs, candidates are required to submit application materials by April 1st.</p>
<p><a href="http://thegenerositytrust.org/tuition-scholarships/dora-maclellan-brown-ministry-scholarship-program/current-recipients" target="_blank">The Generosity Trust</a>&nbsp;administers   the Dora Maclellen Brown Ministry Scholarship Program to help Tennessee   Christians pursue educational credentials at the post-baccalaureate   level.&nbsp; To qualify, applicants must be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>From the Chattanooga region</li>
  <li>Biblical conservative</li>
  <li>Seeking a master&rsquo;s degree at a seminary that has been approved by The Generosity Trust.</li>
</ul>
<p>Doctoral candidates are not eligible, and strong preference for the   scholarship awards&nbsp;is given to students who plan to be pulpit ministers   following completion of their master&rsquo;s programs.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.fteleaders.org/pages/explore-fellowships" target="_blank">Fund for Theological Education</a> grants fellowships for faith based learning.&nbsp; The organization is approaching its sixtieth anniversary and has supplied <a href="http://www.fteleaders.org/pages/explore-fellowships" target="_blank">over 7000 fellowships</a>&nbsp;during   the course of its dedicated service to the ministry.&nbsp; The wide variety   of financial aid put forth for theology students includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ministry Fellowship</li>
  <li>Congregational Fellowship</li>
  <li>Undergraduate Fellowship</li>
  <li>Doctoral Fellowship</li>
  <li>North American Doctoral Fellowship</li>
  <li>Dissertation Fellowship</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.fteleaders.org/pages/vevfellowships" target="_blank">Volunteers Exploring Vocation Fellowship</a>&nbsp;-   National faith based program volunteers are eligible for a 10K   first-year award to pursue master&rsquo;s level theology credentials.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Civic&nbsp;and Church Organizations</h2>
<p>Each individual faith maintains its own share of support for   educating future leaders.&nbsp; As a theology student in need of college   aid,&nbsp;local churches and chapters of national religious organizations   stand as funding opportunities.&nbsp; Look for locally administered programs   that advance your educational goals within your religion.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.discipleshomemissions.org/" target="_blank">Disciples Home Missions</a> organization supports members of the Christian Church called the Disciples of Christ. This organization offers a number of <a href="http://www.discipleshomemissions.org/pages/CV-Scholarships" target="_blank">scholarships for religion&nbsp;and theology students</a>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Disciple Chaplain&rsquo;s Scholarship&nbsp;grants $2,000&nbsp;awards to religion and   theology students in their first year of the seminary. Successful   applicants&nbsp;must attend full-time, have a C+ grade point average, and be   U.S. citizens and&nbsp;members of the Disciples of Christ Church.</li>
  <li>Asian-Americans studying religion or theology who apply for the   David Tamotsu Kagiwada Memorial Scholarship could win a $2,000   educational award. Full-time students must be studying for a future in   the ministry and have at least a C+ average.&nbsp; U. S. citizens and members   of the Disciples of Christ Church are encouraged to apply.</li>
  <li>Wives of ministers have educational options with the Edwin G. and   Lauretta M. Michael Scholarship. This $2,000&nbsp;annual award is given to a   full-time female student who is married to a minister and displays   financial need.</li>
</ul>
<p>These faith-specific resources enable targeted searches for financial aid that speaks to your religious affiliation:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/christian-students.htm">Christian Scholarships </a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/jewish-students.htm">Scholarships for the Jewish faith </a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/muslim-students.htm">Islamic studies Scholarships</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>College and University Scholarships</h2>
<p>Campus-specific financial aid is an important part of the complete   college funding picture.&nbsp; Individual campuses, especially those engaged   in specialized pursuits like training ministers, often put forth the   most generous financial aid available.&nbsp; Program advisers and campus   financial aid offices are best prepared to guide you to financial aid   that applies to your specific theological education goals.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.westminster.edu/" target="_blank">Westminster College</a> in Wilmington Pennsylvania is&nbsp;a Presbyterian school that&nbsp;presents   several scholarships to&nbsp;students with ministerial aspirations.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The John Orr Scholarship Fund is awarded to a religion student who   plans to enter the seminary. Eligible applicants must have taken at   least four religion courses and be in their third year of schooling.   The&nbsp;award is based on the amount of income generated by the interest on   the Fund.</li>
  <li>The James Corry Religion Scholarship Fund is typically awarded to a   college senior with&nbsp;a grade point average of 3.0 whose educational   emphasis is on religion or another major that is preparatory for work   within the Presbyterian church. Awards are structured to cover tuition,   and specific distributions are determined by the level of need that each   student presents. Children of ordained ministers are given preference   for receiving this scholarship.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.highpoint.edu/" target="_blank">High Point University</a> in North Carolina&nbsp;offers scholarships to students majoring in religion   or theology who intend to pursue roles as professional ministers.   Monetary awards vary from&nbsp;year to year, but recent examples include   these memorial scholarship funds.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Irvin B. and Marge P. Black Scholarship is awarded to students majoring in religion or theology.</li>
  <li>The Reverend Chester Andrews Scholarship is for those students&nbsp;studying religion who intend to serve the ministry.</li>
  <li>The John D. Idol Memorial Scholarship benefits a cross-section of theology students enrolled at the school.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.fuller.edu/admissions/finaid/scholarships/sot.aspx" target="_blank">Fuller Theological Seminary</a>&nbsp;in   Pasadena offers several unique financial aid programs for students   pursuing theological degrees.&nbsp; The namesake School of Theology   Scholarship is awarded to a student with exceptional academic   achievement.&nbsp; Other scholarship potential can be found among other   Fuller funds that carry their own distinct eligibility requirements.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Angehr / Westbrook / McMillen Memorial Scholarships are awarded to   young Christians who exhibit strong character, leadership abilities, and   financial need.&nbsp; Successful applicants maintain at least a 3.5 GPA.</li>
  <li>Jose Arreguin Scholarship is available to Hispanic students seeking   financial aid for programs that serve the ministry.&nbsp; Candidates are not   limited to any particular calling, but must be of Spanish ancestry.</li>
  <li>School of Theology Auxiliary Committee Workshop Scholarships go to   high academic performers that are enrolled at least half-time.</li>
  <li>Barnabas Scholarship awards financial assistance, but is also&nbsp;designed to emulate the quiet enabling practices of Barnabas.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.bu.edu/sth/" target="_blank">Boston University School of Theology</a>&nbsp;maintains this <a href="http://www.bu.edu/sth/academics/financial-aid/scholarships/" target="_blank">valuable list</a> of financial aid resources that are available to students of particular   religious callings.&nbsp; These outside sources of theological scholarships,   grants and loans supplement the campus-specific programs put in place   by the school.</p>
