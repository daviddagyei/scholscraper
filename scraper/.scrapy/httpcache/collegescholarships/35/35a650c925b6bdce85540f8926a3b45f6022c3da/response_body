      <h2>  Need Help Paying for Your Books?    </h2>
	  
<p>According to the most recent comprehensive report from the <a href="http://www.gao.gov/" target="_blank">Government Accountability Office</a>,   the average cost of books for each&nbsp;freshman attending a four-year   public university in the 2003-04 school year was $898.00. At four-year   schools, book costs were found to account for 25% of college expenses   and at community colleges the relative price tag was even higher.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ecu.edu/cs-admin/studentstores/Textbooks/upload/Textbook_FAQ.pdf" target="_blank">National Association of College Stores</a> estimated the cost of a year&rsquo;s books at $702 based on data compiled for the organization&rsquo;s 2008 publication, <em>Student Watch</em>.&nbsp; The student advocacy group, <a href="http://research.collegeboard.org/data" target="_blank">College Board</a>,&nbsp;reported&nbsp;estimated   2006-2007 school year spending averages of $800-$1200 for books and   supplies, depending&nbsp;on what program a student chooses.&nbsp; And the Board&rsquo;s   most timely review zero&rsquo;s the number in at $1168 per student, per year.</p>
<p>The data bears it out:&nbsp; College textbooks are expensive.&nbsp; But most   university students don&rsquo;t need a think tank to make that determination.&nbsp;   For them, textbook expenses create ongoing&nbsp;funding challenges that   require creative financial aid solutions.</p>
<p>Half.com is a biased retailer of student media, but survey results   from a&nbsp;1,000 person sampling indicated that half the students polled   would&nbsp;dip into their savings to cover the cost of books. And a majority   (56%) of those surveyed also admitted that they have put off acquiring   the necessary materials for their classes because of the cost.&nbsp;&nbsp;One in   six students reportedly chose not to enroll in or dropped a class   because of the cost of the required textbooks.<img src="https://www.collegescholarships.org/images/textbook-scholarships.jpg" width="283" class="alignright" height="424" alt="textbook scholarships" /></p>
<p>Fortunately,&nbsp;there is relief for college students&nbsp;having trouble   paying for books.&nbsp; Prudent buying strategies help ease the impact of   textbook costs, and various forms of financial assistance can be applied   to textbooks and related classroom supplies.</p>
<h2>Textbook Budgeting 101</h2>
<p>Full-freight retail is the price publishers would like to see you pay   for textbooks, but the model is unsustainable for cash-strapped college   students.&nbsp; When the newest edition is required, or when publications   contain time-sensitive data, the cost of new books is unavoidable, but   in some cases it is still possible to save money on books.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Rent</strong> &ndash; Some campuses facilitate book rental which provides one of the most cost effective textbook solutions.</li>
  <li><strong>Online Resources</strong> &ndash; Some textbook values are realized by buying books from online textbook clearinghouses.</li>
  <li><strong>Used Books</strong> &ndash; The perennial hand me down method has   served generations of college students, who recycle textbooks until   course material requirements are updated.</li>
  <li><strong>E-Books</strong> &ndash; Technology is opening this door for some   college textbooks.&nbsp; If your required textbooks are available for your   e-reader it is the least expensive road to travel.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Familiar Resources Cover Books</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/student-parent.htm">College budgets</a> contain entries for tuition, meals, housing, transportation, fees and   of course;&nbsp;books.&nbsp; For students assembling college financing packages,   where the money goes&nbsp;is not nearly as important as covering the total   cost of a college education.&nbsp; Filling the financial aid pool follows a   standardized protocol that starts with filing the most important   catch-all financial aid request: the FAFSA.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/" target="_blank">Free Application for Federal Student Aid</a>&nbsp;is   the standardized federal application that is also used by states and   other financial aid guarantors.&nbsp; Textbook scholarships don&rsquo;t always   require data provided on the FAFSA,&nbsp; but so much financial assistance   starts with filing the form that it pays to&nbsp;submit the completed   application well before the filing deadline.</p>
<p>Federal, state and private financial aid is generally not restricted for use buying textbooks, so scholarships, <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/grants/">grants</a> and loans are fair game for textbook financing.&nbsp; If money remains after tuition is paid, use <a href="http://studentaid.ed.gov/types/grants-scholarships/pell" target="_blank">Pell Grants</a> and <a href="http://www.direct.ed.gov/" target="_blank">Federal Direct Loans</a> to underwrite bookstore bills.&nbsp; And include targeted textbook   scholarships as part of your plan.&nbsp; These examples illustrate the range   of textbook philanthropy sponsored by associations, foundations and   other student benefactors.</p>
<h3>Helping Hands Book Scholarship Program</h3>
<p>One-time awards of $100.00 &ndash; $1,000.00 are awarded&nbsp;to   college/university, technical, vocational,&nbsp;and graduate students. High   school students (over the age of 16)&nbsp;are invited <a href="http://www.lehigh.edu/%7Einfao/OutsideScholarship/Helping%20Hands%20Scholarship.pdf" target="_blank">to apply</a> for aid directed toward one of these institutions of higher learning.&nbsp;   Applicants must&nbsp;attend an institution in the United States, Canada, or   Mexico. Funding is available for fall and spring semesters.</p>
<h3>The Passageway Scholarship Program</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.passagewayfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Passageway Scholarship Foundation</a> helps challenged youth groups gain footings in higher education.&nbsp;   Scholarships and book grants help neglected and delinquent students   reach their career and educational goals.&nbsp; Funding applies to programs   at 4-year universities, community colleges and trade schools.&nbsp;   Recipients have attended schools like <a href="http://www.pepperdine.edu/" target="_blank">Pepperdine</a>, University of Utah and <a href="http://www.mesacc.edu/" target="_blank">Mesa Community College</a>.</p>
<h3>WIHE Book Scholarship</h3>
<p>To help offset the cost of college textbooks for female college students, <a href="http://www.wihe.com/" target="_blank">Women in Higher Education</a> helps raise money and grants its own book scholarships.&nbsp; Several   scholarships are distributed annually at multiple college campuses   across the U.S.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://www.collegescholarships.org/images/college-scholarships.jpg" width="425" class="alignright" height="282" alt="books for college" /></p>
<h3>Barnes and Noble Book Scholarships</h3>
<p>Corporate philanthropy funds campus-based book scholarships sponsored by the retail book giant.&nbsp; At <a href="http://www.pace.edu/prospectivestudents/undergraduate/financial-aid/scholarships-and-grants" target="_blank">Pace University</a>,   each Barnes and Noble award is valued at $500 per semester.&nbsp; Successful   applicants are full-time undergraduate students with grade point   averages above 2.0.&nbsp; Financial need, as demonstrated by FAFSA results is   required for application.&nbsp; Each participating campus provides multiple   awards annually.</p>
<h3>Carl A. Scott Book Scholarships</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.cswe.org/CentersInitiatives/ScholarshipsandFellowships/CarlAScottMemorialFund14531.aspx#Book_Scholarships" target="_blank">Council on Social Work Education</a> (CSWE) awards two $500.00 scholarships each year to students completing   their final years of study in CSWE-accredited Bachelor&rsquo;s&nbsp;and a Masters   Degree&nbsp;programs in <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/social-worker.htm">Social Work</a>.&nbsp;   &nbsp;Applicants from these diverse student groups are encouraged: Puerto   Rican, Asian American, American Indian, African American, and Mexican   American.&nbsp; Equity and social justice provide the scholarship&rsquo;s theme.</p>
<h3>NACE Book Scholarship Program</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.nace-foundation.org/Default.aspx?tabid=71" target="_blank">The NACE Foundation</a> invites graduate students who are Student Members of NACE to apply   for&nbsp;book scholarships worth up to $1,000 each. The purpose of the   scholarships is to help graduate students&nbsp;establish or add to their   personal libraries of corrosion-related books. North American and   International students are eligible to apply with qualifying GPA   information, and two written recommendations. Successful applicants   wishing to accept their award in person, at the NACE Annual Conference,   are eligible for financial assistance to help defray the cost of travel.</p>
<h3>Re-Entry Student Book Scholarship</h3>
<p><a href="http://tooele.usu.edu/financial/re_entry_book_scholarship.cfm" target="_blank">Utah State University</a> provides unique textbook resources for students returning to college   after an absence.&nbsp; The school&rsquo;s book scholarships are reserved for   students who have experienced five-year absences from college, within   the previous six-years.&nbsp; Returning students exhibiting commitments to   academic success are evaluated for the award based on scholastic   performance and other metrics.&nbsp; The program specifically benefits   students on the <a href="http://tooele.usu.edu/" target="_blank">USU Tooele Campus</a>, and awards may not be transferred to other schools.</p>
<h3>Casimiro Foundation Book Scholarships</h3>
<p>Business students from&nbsp;two&nbsp;and four-year programs benefit from <a href="http://www.casimiroglobalfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Casimiro Global Foundation</a> assistance.&nbsp;Under the organization&rsquo;s book scholarship program,   applicants enrolled full or part-time must maintain college GPA   standards of at least 2.0 to remain eligible.&nbsp; Awards are distributed   based on the financial needs of qualified applicants.</p>
<p>Since book scholarships are often campus-specific or regionally   distributed, your college financial aid office is always the best   source&nbsp;for up-to-date student aid information.</p>
