<h2>Benefits for Military Spouses</h2>
	  	  
<p>Military families make extraordinary sacrifices, and it is difficult   for civilian families to truly understand the hardships they endure.   While there is no way to truly repay them for their service, there are   some rewards that can help to ease their burdens. Scholarships are one   way of giving back to the families of military service members, and to   provide much needed financial assistance for the spouses and children of   service-men and women as they pursue a college education.</p>
<p>Scholarships for military spouses take a variety of different forms,   and are supported by the various branches of the military, as well as   Federal and state governments. Some scholarships target the wives and   husbands of currently serving military personnel. Others are dedicated   to the spouses of service members who have been killed or disabled in   service to their country. The wide range of scholarships for military   spouses are designed to help military family members pursue their   college education. It is a small way of giving back to the military   community, and it helps thousands of men and women every year to achieve   their college ambitions.<img src="https://www.collegescholarships.org/images/military-spouses-scholarshipsjpg.jpg" class="alignright"

<h2>Scholarship Opportunities</h2>
<p>Scholarships for military spouses are supported by a variety of   sources. Each branch of the United States military offers some level of   financial aid for its service members and their families. Many state   governments, as well as many civic groups interested in the welfare of   military families, also provide ample scholarship opportunities for   veterans and their spouses. Scholarship programs for military spouses,   regardless of sponsor, all have one thing in common : they are designed   to recognize and reward the great sacrifices made by service-members and   their families.</p>
<h2>Scholarships Supported by the Military</h2>
<p>The most substantial source of scholarships for military spouses are   the armed forces themselves. Each branch of the military provides a   variety of financial aid programs to support the educational goals of   enlisted personnel and their families. The following examples of   scholarships for military spouses are directly supported by the United   States military.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The U.S. Army sponsors the <a href="http://www.aerhq.org/dnn563/EducationalAssistance/Spouses.aspx" target="_blank">Spouse Education Assistance Program</a>.   This need-based scholarship provides financial assistance to the   spouses of Army soldiers who are pursuing an undergraduate degree. To be   eligible, applicants must be the spouse of either a soldier on active   duty, a retired soldier, or of a soldier who died while in service.   Applicants must be enrolled in an accredited college or university, and   must maintain a 2.0 GPA. The scholarship is renewable for up to four   years.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.nmcrs.org/" target="_blank">U.S. Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society</a> sponsors the <a href="http://www.nmcrs.org/goldstar.pdf" target="_blank">Gold Star Scholarship Program</a> for the dependent children and spouses of Navy and Marine personnel who   were killed in the line of duty. Awards are determined by a combination   of financial need and academic merit, and range from $500 to $2500 per   academic year.</li>
  <li>The<a href="http://www.nmcrs.org/goldstar.pdf" target="_blank"> Joseph A. McAlinden Divers Scholarship</a> is available to the dependent spouses of active duty Navy divers.   Applicants must be enrolled in an accredited oceanography program at a   participating college or university. Awards are determined by financial   need and academic merit, and range from $500 to $3000.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.coastguardfoundation.org/how/scholarships/directory" target="_blank">Coast Guard Foundation</a> supports the <strong><em>USAA Enlisted Coast Guard Reservist Family Scholarship</em></strong>for   the families of enlisted and reservist Coast Guard personnel. Six $1000   scholarships are awarded annually to the dependent children and spouses   of eligible Coast Guard personnel.</li>
</ul>
<h2>State Supported Scholarships for Military Spouses</h2>
<p>Every state in the country has a dedicated Department of Higher   Education, through which the state administers a variety of financial   aid programs for its resident students. Many states also have a   Department of Veteran&rsquo;s Affairs, which provide financial assistance to   military personnel and their families. These programs will vary widely   from state to state, and students are encouraged to research the   programs that may be available within their state.</p>
<p>The following examples should highlight the types of scholarships for military spouses that are available at the state level.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.va.state.al.us/" target="_blank">Alabama Department Veteran&rsquo;s Affairs</a> supports the <a href="http://www.va.state.al.us/scholarship.htm" target="_blank">G. I. Dependents&rsquo; Scholarship Program</a> for the spouses and children of military veterans. To be eligible,   applicants must be Alabama residents, and must be the spouse or child of   an honorably discharged veteran, or of a veteran who was disabled or   killed in the service of their country.</li>
  <li>Connecticut sponsors their <a href="http://www.ctohe.org/edinfo/pdfs/VeteransTuitionWaiver.pdf" target="_blank">Veteran&rsquo;s Tuition Waiver</a> for the surviving spouses of military service personnel who were killed   in the line of duty after September 11, 2001. While not strictly a   scholarship, this program provides much needed financial assistance to   military widows and widowers who are struggling to complete their   college education following the death of their spouse. Students must   apply through the financial aid offices of their college of attendance,   or through Connecticut&rsquo;s Department of Veteran&rsquo;s Affairs.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.mhec.state.md.us/" target="_blank">Maryland Higher Education Commission</a> sponsors the <a href="http://www.mhec.state.md.us/financialAid/ProgramDescriptions/prog_vaic.asp" target="_blank">Veterans of the Afghanistan and Iraq Conflict Scholarship</a>.   This program offers scholarships to Afghanistan and Iraq veterans,   their dependent children and spouses, who are enrolled in degree-seeking   undergraduate programs at a Maryland state college or university.   Maximum scholarship awards may not exceed 50% of the applicant&rsquo;s full   tuition costs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Scholarships Supported by Civic Groups and Charitable Associations</h2>
<p>Many charitable groups exist around the country to support the needs,   both financial and emotional, of military families. A large number of   these groups support scholarships for the children and spouses of active   duty military personnel, veterans and POW/MIA&rsquo;s. While many of these   programs may not offer the same level of financial assistance as their   state supported and military supported counterparts, they do provide   valuable assistance to military spouses struggling to pay for college.</p>
<p>The few examples that follow illustrate the types of scholarship   programs offered by charitable foundations and civic groups around the   country. Interested students can find further information on scholarship   programs for military spouses by contacting local military family   support groups.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.militaryfamily.org/" target="_blank">National Military Family Association</a> is dedicated to supporting the needs of military families across the country. The NMFA administers the <a href="http://www.militaryfamily.org/our-programs/military-spouse-scholarships/" target="_blank">Joanne Holbrook Patton Military Spouse Scholarship</a> which is designed to prepare military spouses for meaningful   employment. Scholarships may be used for vocational training,   professional certification, undergraduate and graduate school.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.thanksusa.org/main/index.html" target="_blank">ThanksUSA</a> is a charitable foundation dedicated to helping military families achieve their educational goals. The <strong><em>ThanksUSA Scholarship</em></strong> provides up to $3000 in funds to eligible spouses of active duty, and   reservist, military personnel. Applicants must be enrolled in an   accredited college or university to be considered eligible for any   award.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.salutetospouses.com/" target="_blank">Salute to Spouses</a> is a national support group looking after the needs of military spouses   and their children. In addition to providing counseling and career   advice, Salute to Spouses administers a variety of scholarships for   military dependents, including the <a href="http://www.foldsofhonor.org/scholarships" target="_blank">Folds of Honor Scholarship</a> and the <a href="http://www.hopeforthewarriors.org/story/18727849/spouse-caregiver-scholarships" target="_blank">Hope for the Warriors Scholarship</a> for the spouses of military personnel who have been disabled in the   service of their country. These scholarships put an emphasis on   vocational training, and post-secondary education programs that are   designed to give military spouses the education they need to advance in   the national workforce.</li>
</ul>
<p>Military service-members and their families occupy a unique position   in the American population. They sacrifice much to defend the ideals of   our nation, and one of our most precious ideals is the right to a higher   education. Scholarships for military spouses provide more than just   financial assistance, they provide a validation of the great sacrifices   military families make on behalf of all of the citizens of the United   States.</p>
