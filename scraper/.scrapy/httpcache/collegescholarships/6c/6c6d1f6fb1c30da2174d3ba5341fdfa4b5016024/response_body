      <h2> Stretching Your Budget Too Much?    </h2>
	  
<p>Higher education&nbsp;creates cash flow problems for students no matter   what they are studying, but&nbsp;credentials for technical careers&nbsp;like   physical therapy can be particularly costly to acquire due to advanced   education requirements.&nbsp; Bachelor&rsquo;s degrees only get you so far in   medical fields, so students advancing to post-baccalaureate programs   need additional financial aid.&nbsp; Federal and state aid helps get the job   done with loans, grants and scholarships, but <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/subject-specific.htm">career-specific&nbsp;assistance</a> is also available for physical therapy majors.</p>
<h2>Scholarships from Physical Therapy Schools</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://ortho.wisc.edu/Home.aspx" target="_blank">University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Orthopedics and Rehabilitation</a> supports student education with campus-specific aid for PT applicants.&nbsp;   Some programs speak to the needs of first-year students with   early-career aid that is often harder to find.&nbsp; These competitive awards   honor Wisconsin physical therapy professionals and others who have been   helped by the profession:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://ortho.wisc.edu/Home/DoctorofPhysicalTherapy/StudentLife/Scholarships.aspx" target="_blank">Caroline, Clara, Charles and Mildred Harper Scholarship</a> &ndash; Two female first year Physical Therapy students who show financial   need and outstanding academic achievement are rewarded with scholarships   worth more than $1000 each.&nbsp; Candidates submit applications during   freshman year, and the earned awards are applied to 2nd year tuition.</li>
  <li>Barbara Ellen Gerlich-Hoefeyzer Scholarship -&nbsp;$800 scholarships are   awarded to&nbsp;first&nbsp; and second year Physical Therapy students who show   financial need, outstanding academic abilities and&nbsp; leadership potential   within the Physical Therapy community.</li>
  <li>Margaret Kohli Scholarship &ndash; Physical Therapy students earn tuition   assistance for second year coursework by winning the Kohli grant.&nbsp; This   $2,000 scholarship is reserved for high academic performers and those   applicants displaying strong leadership and career potential.<img src="https://www.collegescholarships.org/images/physical-therapy-scholarships.jpg" width="283" class="alignright" height="424" alt="physical therapy scholarships" /></li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="http://unc.edu/" target="_blank">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a>&nbsp;offers   scholarships to eligible Physical Therapy students. Financial need and   scholastic excellence are&nbsp;two&nbsp;heavily weighted&nbsp;criteria for selecting   recipients.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/ahs/student-services/pt-scholarships#beatty" target="_blank">Charlotte Money Beatty Memorial Scholarship Fund</a> &ndash; Minority Physical Therapy students are given first preference for   earning this award.&nbsp; The size of the award varies from year to year, and   second consideration is given to students pursuing pediatric   specialties within the field.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/ahs/student-services/pt-scholarships" target="_blank">Rebecca Irene Sande Scholarship Fund</a> &ndash; This memorial award is made possible by a bequest of over 700K that   opened the program honoring Mrs. Sande.&nbsp; 10 annual scholarships are   issued to worthy candidates within the school&rsquo;s Master&rsquo;s of Physical   Therapy program.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.umflint.edu/pt/Entry-LevelDPT/scholarships.htm" target="_blank">University of Michigan &ndash; Flint</a>&nbsp;offers   at least twelve distinct scholarships for students within the physical   therapy department.&nbsp; The campus administered funds recognize a variety   of Flint Alums and other notable physical therapists, including these   recent UM-Flint awards.:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.umflint.edu/pt/documents/Scholarship.Potter%20Guidelines.pdf" target="_blank">David Potter Memorial Scholarship</a> fund honors its namesake, a non-traditional PT student from Flint who   overcame adversity to become a beloved service provider.&nbsp; The   Scholarship specifically&nbsp;supports those students entering physical   therapy programs as second careers.&nbsp; General requirements and   scholarship parameters:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li>Academic good standing</li>
  <li>Strong community service record</li>
  <li>Student-submitted essay outlining academic and career goals</li>
  <li>Funds are applied directly to student account</li>
  <li>Scholarships are renewable, but students must reapply</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.umflint.edu/pt/documents/Scholarship.Roth%20Guidelines.pdf" target="_blank">Bradley Roth Memorial Scholarships</a>&nbsp;are   for Flint students enrolled full time in physical therapy programs.&nbsp;   The annual&nbsp;honor marks the tragic loss of Mr. Roth, who was killed in a   car accident.&nbsp; The scholarship targets students who have significant   financial need and the ability to maintain a GPA of at least 3.0.&nbsp; The   scholarship does not automatically renew, but past winners are eligible   to reapply.&nbsp; Professionalism and core competency in physical therapy   generic abilities are required for participation in this program.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Physical Therapy Associations</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.apta.org/currentstudents/scholarshipsawards/" target="_blank">American Physical Therapy Association</a> awards scholarships each year through its philanthropic foundation.&nbsp;   Several students currently enrolled in&nbsp;post-doctoral studies benefit   from the Association&rsquo;s efforts each year. The stable of APTA student   assistance also includes these opportunities for PT majors.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.apta.org/HonorsandAwards/Scholarships/MinorityScholarship/" target="_blank">Minority Scholarship Awards </a>are   issued to students in the final years of their physical therapy   programs.&nbsp; Minority faculty members pursuing post-professional degrees   are also eligible to apply.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.apta.org/HonorsAwards/Scholarships/McMillanScholarship/" target="_blank">Mary Mcmillan Scholarships</a> benefit physical therapy assistant students, as well as those studying   to become professional physical therapists.&nbsp; The awards are worth $3000   each for assistants and $5000 for students enrolled in professional PT   programs.&nbsp; Participating institutions of higher education are limited to   a single annual nomination in each scholarship category.&nbsp; Nominees are   in their final years of study in PT programs.&nbsp; Mcmillan Scholarships   recognize academic achievement, specifically evaluating applicants on   the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scholastic performance</li>
  <li>Past Productivity</li>
  <li>Potential Contribution to the Physical Therapy Profession</li>
  <li>Service to the American Physical Therapy Association</li>
</ul>
<p>Student-members of the APTA are eligible for the organization&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.apta.org/CurrentStudents/ScholarshipsAwards/OutstandingPTPTA/" target="_blank">Outstanding PT and PTA Student Awards</a>.&nbsp; Qualified students are encouraged to apply on their own, or can be nominated by a learning institution.</p>
<p>Specialized scholarships originate form the organization&rsquo;s individual sections, including these physical therapy disciplines:<img src="https://www.collegescholarships.org/images/nursing-grants-and-scholarships.jpg" class="alignright" width="283" height="424" alt="physical therapy college scholarships" /></p>
<ul>
  <li>Neurology</li>
  <li>Orthopedics</li>
  <li>Pediatrics</li>
  <li>Performing Arts</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="http://www.tpta.org/" target="_blank">Texas Physical Therapy Association</a> operates a foundation&nbsp;that awards scholarships to deserving students.   The foundation puts its money where its mouth is in three distinct ways   to promote the physical therapy profession.&nbsp; Funds earned by the   foundation are directed to worthy industry initiatives like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Research grants</li>
  <li>Grants to fund scholarships for students enrolled in PT programs</li>
  <li>Fiscal support for physical therapy educational programs and faculty</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="http://www.wpta.org/wptfund.cfm" target="_blank">Wisconsin Physical Therapy Association</a> supports education through a philanthropic fund established for   physical therapists in 1969.&nbsp; Professional scholarships fund education   for applicants meeting these standards:</p>
<ul>
  <li>U.S. Citizen</li>
  <li>Enrolled at accredited college, university or technical school.</li>
  <li>Member of WPTA</li>
  <li>Graduating within one year of winning award</li>
  <li>Completed application</li>
  <li>Two letters of reference; one each from personal and professional associates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Applicants are judged on these criteria:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Financial need</li>
  <li>Academic standing</li>
  <li>Community involvement</li>
  <li>Assessment of letters of recommendation</li>
</ul>
<p>Some educational assistance originates from national organizations,   but Physical Therapy Associations in individual states are active in   their own efforts to support college students earning PT degrees.&nbsp;   Specific details about college financing opportunities are available   from&nbsp;state associations and university physical therapy departments.</p>
<h2>Foundation Support and Other Sources of Funding</h2>
<p>Physical therapy majors financing college are best-served by a   catch-all approach that accounts for all the financial aid resources   that might apply. Sometimes, it is not a matter of what you know, but   which organizations you are affiliated with.&nbsp; Clubs, advocacy groups,   religious organizations and community foundations each support education   in their own ways.&nbsp; Take stock of your unique memberships and the   individual personality traits that might open doors for college cash.&nbsp;   These examples illustrate the wide range of funding sources for physical   therapy school assistance:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dar.org/natsociety/edout_scholar.cfm" target="_blank">Daughters of the American Revolution</a> (DAR) distributes an array of scholarships annually, including one for   occupational and physical therapy majors.&nbsp;The scholarship is   administered through the organization&rsquo;s nursing scholarship program, and   includes art, music and other physical therapy specialties.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iokds.org/scholarship1.html" target="_blank">International Order of the King&rsquo;s Daughters and Sons</a> is a Christian interdenominational organization with branches in the   United States and Canada. The group&nbsp;works on a number of projects   including hospital administration&nbsp;and programs for youth. The Order   offers several scholarship awards annually&nbsp;as part of the Health Careers   Scholarship Program. Students preparing for&nbsp;health related careers &ndash;   including Physical Therapy majors &ndash; are eligible to apply for   scholarships that are typically valued around $1,000 each.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.asahp.org/" target="_blank">The Association of Schools of Allied Health Professions</a> offers its own distinct scholarship programs for students enrolled in   accredited allied health programs. Candidates are nominated by learning   institutions that choose promising applicants from health fields like   physical therapy.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tylenol.com/page.jhtml?id=tylenol/news/subptyschol.inc" target="_blank">Tylenol Future Care Scholarships</a>&nbsp;distribute   college assistance to worthy&nbsp;students enrolled in educational programs   preparing them to serve as health care professionals.&nbsp; More than 100   awards are up for grabs each academic year.&nbsp; The grants serve   undergraduate students and those studying at the post-baccalaureate   level.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hawaiicommunityfoundation.org/scholarships" target="_blank">Hawaii Community Foundation</a>&nbsp;dispenses   community improvement grants that help fund a host of local activities,   but the group is also in the business of lifting qualified students   into higher education.&nbsp; Each award has its own eligibility   requirements&nbsp;and some address specific vocations like physical   therapy.&nbsp;For instance, nursing students and future physical therapists   are invited to apply for the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hawaiicommunityfoundation.org/scholarships/scholarship-detail?pack=1&amp;id=100" target="_blank">Paulina L. Sorg Scholarship</a>, which benefits college juniors, seniors and graduate students. The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.koaanuenue.org/endowing-future-dr-alvin-and-monica-saake-foundation" target="_blank">Dr. Alvin &amp; Monica Saake Foundation Scholarship</a> is reserved for students pursuing degrees in medicine, occupational   therapy, physical therapy, exercise science, physical education and   other health/wellness related fields.</p>
