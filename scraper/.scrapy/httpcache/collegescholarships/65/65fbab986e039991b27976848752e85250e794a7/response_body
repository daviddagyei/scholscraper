      <h2>Are You the First in Your Family to Attend College?</h2>
      <p>General financial aid is a starting point for most college students,   but to cover the costs of higher education, students turn to specialized   grants and scholarships&nbsp;that are only available to certain members of   the student body.</p>
      <p>Some grants and scholarships carry a mission, to distribute aid in a   way that benefits targeted students. Minority scholarships that require   applicants to exhibit certain ethnic heritage, or women-only financial   aid are examples of student assistance that addresses the educational   needs of&nbsp;particular student groups.</p>
      <p>Access to higher education is an important measure of progress, so   families that are sending their first members to college are given   special consideration in the form of First in Family Scholarships.&nbsp; If   you are your family&rsquo;s first college student, this aid provides a leg-up   towards increased educational mobility.</p>
      <p>The scholarships are funded by&nbsp;public and private dollars, and   administered according to the individual standards of each award.&nbsp;   Students who qualify for first in family scholarships will be subject to   a variety of performance and need-based requirements.&nbsp; First in family   scholarships commonly require minimum GPAs that are above average, as   well as&nbsp;financial need related to college.</p>
