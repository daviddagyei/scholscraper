      <h2>  Acquire Your Degree without Debt    </h2>
	  
<p>Engineering students seek financial aid from conventional sources like stalwart federal programs: <a href="http://studentaid.ed.gov/types/grants-scholarships/pell" target="_blank">Pell Grants</a> and <a href="http://www.direct.ed.gov/" target="_blank">Direct Student Loans</a>, but additional financial assistance is often&nbsp;required to meet the costs of higher education.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/states.htm">State-specific financial aid</a> helps bridge the affordability gap for college students across the   country; including engineering majors.&nbsp;&nbsp;And privately funded education   initiatives from corporations and industry groups provide <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/subject-specific.htm">career-specific college tuition aid</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/student-specific.htm">Who you are</a>, and where you go to school are relevant financial aid concerns, but <em>what you study</em> is equally important.&nbsp; STEM subjects &ndash; those relating to science,   technology, engineering and math &ndash; provide fertile ground for targeted   career-centric student aid.&nbsp;Grants and scholarships for the best and   brightest talent drives these forward thinking fields.&nbsp; Engineering   scholarships are usually tied to academic performance, but other   applicant characteristics are also used to determine who earns the   awards.&nbsp; Your background, location, civic engagement, marital status and   a host of other factors can be used to open financial aid doors within   engineering education.<img src="https://www.collegescholarships.org/images/engineering-student-scholarships.jpg" class="alignright" width="283" height="424" alt="Engineering student scholarships" /></p>
<p>This diverse set of examples illustrates the wide range of organizations&nbsp;that provide scholarship support for student engineers.</p>
