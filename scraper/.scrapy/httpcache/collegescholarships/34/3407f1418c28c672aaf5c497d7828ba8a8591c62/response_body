<h2>Your Company May Provide 100% Funding for Your College Degree</h2>
	  	  
<p>Meeting the extraordinary&nbsp;<a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/loans/average-debt.htm">costs of higher education </a>requires creative financing solutions that draw from every available resource.&nbsp; Traditional types of financial aid like <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/">scholarships</a>, grants and <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/loans/">loans</a> are&nbsp;used in combination, to bride the affordability gap that exists for   most college students.&nbsp;&nbsp;And expenses&nbsp;go beyond tuition; students&nbsp;also   need help paying for room and board, books and school fees.</p>
<p>Assistance comes from many sources; including <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/grants/federal.htm">government agencies </a>and   private sector philanthropists, but one valuable source of student aid   is often overlooked.&nbsp; Within business and industry, forward-thinking   companies are dedicated to increasing access to education for students   who can&rsquo;t afford to continue beyond secondary school.&nbsp; Your ticket to   college might originate from your employer.</p>
<p>Where&nbsp;in-service training once kept employees up to speed, the <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/subject-specific.htm">specialized workforce</a> employed by modern companies increasingly requires highly-technical   training that cannot be provided on the job. To stay ahead of the curve,   corporate human resources departments put forth incentives&nbsp;to send   employees back to school.<img src="https://www.collegescholarships.org/images/tuition-reimbursement.jpg" class="alignright" width="300" height="400" alt="tuition reimbursement" /></p>
<p>Employer reimbursement programs (ERP) are company-funded initiatives   that reward employees who seek additional educational   credentials.&nbsp;Investing in employee development is a&nbsp;short-term expense   for&nbsp;businesses that understand the value of&nbsp; highly educated personnel.   Successful manufacturers and other competitive companies sponsor   scholarships and grants that lift <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/low-income.htm">disadvantaged students </a>into   higher education, but they also participate in additional financial aid   programs that provide direct student aid for their employees.</p>
<p>Tuition reimbursement programs are distinguishable from other   traditional forms of student aid, because tuition costs are paid up   front, by&nbsp;each participating student.&nbsp; Once program criteria have been   met, students are paid back for their tuition investments.&nbsp; The unique   form of individual aid&nbsp; increases the&nbsp;career-life quality for each   qualified student; providing educational access to working populations   that would otherwise be barred from college due to high tuition costs.&nbsp;   At the same time, companies maintain a&nbsp;well-educated workforce by   providing employees with cutting-edge exposure to developing industry   trends.</p>
<h2>Program Coverage and Criteria</h2>
<p>Each reimbursement plan carries its own eligibility standards, so it   is important to understand what is required for participation.&nbsp; Your   employer or sponsoring organization has its own agenda, so don&rsquo;t assume   that every plan will be administered in the same way.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/fortune500.htm">Corporate human resources</a> offices are charged with operating most company tuition reimbursement   plans, so HR is a good place to uncover details about your education   financing alternatives.&nbsp; Weigh these important considerations as you   contemplate your company funded higher education:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>What pays?</strong> &ndash; Commonly, company tuition payment   plans relate to courses that are specifically germane to the business of   the company.&nbsp; Make sure your coursework is covered within the   reimbursement guidelines of&nbsp;your employer&rsquo;s&nbsp;tuition plan.</li>
  <li><strong>How much?</strong> &ndash; Corporate reimbursement programs limit   the amount that may be claimed each semester.&nbsp; For example, your company   may reimburse you for a certain number of credits or classes during   each academic term.&nbsp; Dollar limits are also present on some   reimbursement plans.&nbsp; To avoid over-committing, determine the   reimbursement thresholds allowed for each scholastic period &ndash; before you   enroll.</li>
  <li><strong>Time limits?</strong> &ndash; Your plan might include time limits   that require you to finish an academic program, or earn a degree, within   a certain number of semesters.&nbsp; To stay eligible for reimbursement,   follow specific program timetables precisely.</li>
  <li><strong>Performance parameters?</strong>&nbsp;- Don&rsquo;t count on   reimbursement until you are sure your level of academic achievement   qualifies for program benefits.&nbsp; To stimulate proper performance,   administrators include GPA and other performance metrics as program   eligibility standards.</li>
  <li><strong>Service requirements?</strong> &ndash; Your company wants to   benefit from your education.&nbsp; You may be required to remain employed   with them for a specific period of time following school.</li>
  <li><strong>What if?</strong>&nbsp;- Students drop classes for a host of   reasons, but the ripple effect might impact your tuition payment plan.&nbsp;   Be prepared to lose your reimbursement benefits when you drop out of   your educational program.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Industry Employees Benefit from Education Reimbursement</h2>
<p>Reimbursement efforts are not limited to any particular segment of   the workforce, but professionals employed within the educational system   have fingertip access to &nbsp;job-paid higher learning. Staffers at   universities and community colleges enjoy reimbursement benefits like   these:</p>
<p><a href="http://hr.caltech.edu/education/tuition_reimbursement.htm" target="_blank">California Institute of Technology</a>&nbsp;-   Employee participants earned subsidized education reimbursement worth   up to $5000 annually for qualified undergraduates.&nbsp; As an employer,   Caltech remains committed to helping staffers obtain and maintain   advanced credentials in professional educational disciplines.&nbsp; studies   must be undertaken at accredited colleges and universities, and at   approved centers specializing in&nbsp; vocational training. Applications   include tuition receipts and proof of performance for each class taken,   which exhibits a grade of C or better.</p>
<p><a href="http://www4.uwm.edu/hr/faculty_and_staff/classified/tuition_reimbursement.cfm" target="_blank">University of Wisconsin &ndash; Milwaukee</a>&nbsp;-   The UWM program is strictly limited to one course per semester.&nbsp;   Qualified employee-applicants are paid-in-full each semester for one   University class that is:</p>
<p><strong>Job-Related</strong> &ndash; Imparts a new skill required to continue performing at the highest related vocational standard.</p>
<p><strong>Career-Related</strong> &ndash; Long-term career advancement is enhanced by participation in an industry accepted educational program.</p>
<h2>Extra Costs</h2>
<p>Responsibility for ancillary costs associated with school is likely   to fall under your own financial umbrella.&nbsp;Tuition reimbursement   programs often stop short of <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/student-books.htm">paying for books</a>,   fees and other auxiliary&nbsp;program costs.&nbsp;Out-of-pocket potential for   your educational pursuits is drastically reduced by employer sponsored   tuition reimbursement, but you will incur expenses along the way.&nbsp; And   don&rsquo;t lose sight of your tuition payment obligations.&nbsp; <strong>You are responsible for paying your tuition bill; reimbursement&nbsp;pays you back for your tuition investment.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h2>Levels of Reimbursement</h2>
<p>ERPs stipulate the <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/student-specific.htm">types of degrees</a> and courses eligible for reimbursement, so your participation does not   guarantee a full-ride through school. Even though tuition reimbursement   plans apply to various degree programs, it is important to&nbsp;clear your   eligibility status it with the HR department before enrolling.&nbsp;   Companies reimburse undergrads and advanced students earning these   credentials:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/graduate-students.htm">Master&rsquo;s Degree</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/undergraduate-students.htm">Bachelor&rsquo;s Degree</a></li>
  <li>Associate&rsquo;s Degree</li>
  <li>Certificate</li>
</ul>
<p>Your out of pocket payments are reduced by participating in   programs&nbsp;covered by your TR plan. In some cases, you may be allowed to   pursue a course of study outside your current job area, but most   companies will only repay you for courses, degrees or programs that   directly relate to your job responsibilities.</p>
<h2>Opportunities for Non-Traditional Students</h2>
<p>Tuition reimbursement programs benefit a wide cross-section of the   workforce, but the very&nbsp;nature of the programs disproportionately   benefits <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/returning-students.htm">working adults</a>.&nbsp;   The&nbsp;general lack of available funds for higher education is thwarted by   employee benefit initiatives that give staffers money for school. But   to tap corporate sponsorship, you must first be employed.</p>
<p>Now that&nbsp;ERPs help remove funding&nbsp;obstacles for knowledge-hungry   employees,&nbsp;experts say savvy workers are making&nbsp;moves into more   lucrative fields&nbsp;and more prominent positions. According to <a href="http://www.sbnonline.com/" target="_blank"><em>Smart Business</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;More and more working adults are seeking out educational   services designed for the working adult. Seminar-style learning   environments, evening courses and e-learning are becoming increasingly   popular choices for busy professionals seeking to enrich themselves with   education.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Tuition Reimbursement Management Services</h2>
<p>Like many privately funded scholarship initiatives, large-scale   tuition reimbursement programs may&nbsp;prove&nbsp;unmanageable for&nbsp;companies&nbsp;and   organizations wishing to handle them in-house. Contract companies like <a href="http://scholarshipamerica.org/" target="_blank">Scholarship America</a>, <a href="http://www.interplx.com/" target="_blank">InterplX</a> and <a href="http://www.act.org/" target="_blank">ACT</a> provide scalable services that help administer tuition reimbursement   programs. Available services cover plan advertisement,&nbsp;application,   design, selection, sorting&nbsp;and remittance of reimbursement funds.</p>
<p>Improperly managed reimbursement programs are counterproductive to   the educational missions of philanthropic employee-oriented companies.&nbsp;   Professional management&nbsp;services tackle reimbursement issues that fall   outside the core functions of a typical HR department; fostering   employee compliance and high tuition-plan participation rates.</p>
