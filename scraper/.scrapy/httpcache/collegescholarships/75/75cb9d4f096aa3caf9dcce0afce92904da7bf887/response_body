      <h2>Easily Search for Subject and Student-Specific Awards</h2>
      <p>Loans, scholarships and grants are important resources for college   students seeking to make ends meet.&nbsp; At the end of the day, college   students rely on&nbsp;financial aid packages that contain all three types of   financing.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/loans/">Loans</a> get the   job done, but even though interest rates are low for college students,   the money needs to be paid back eventually.&nbsp; Grants and scholarships are   coveted college cash sources, because the money you receive does not   require repayment.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/grants/index.htm">Grants</a> are primarily need-based, reserved for students exhibiting the greatest   levels of financial hardship paying for college.&nbsp; Scholarships, on the   other hand, usually reflect a high academic standard; so&nbsp;candidates are   required to hold high grade point averages and do well on tests.</p>
      <p>There are&nbsp;thousands of scholarship programs open to   undergraduates,&nbsp;so qualifying may be easier than you think.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your   school&rsquo;s financial aid office&nbsp;and your high-school guidance counselor   are primary resources for up-to-date scholarship information.&nbsp;   Government agencies, professional associations, corporations and   advocacy groups are&nbsp;all in the business of doling out scholarship   dollars, so leave no stone unturned&nbsp;in your quest for college cash.</p>
      <p>Each scholarship makes up its own rules, so don&rsquo;t count yourself out   for being different.&nbsp; Student-specific financial aid is aimed at certain   groups within the student body.&nbsp; Your location, ethnic background,   gender or some other unique feature might be&nbsp;your key to landing   undergraduate scholarships.</p>
      <p>Subject-specific scholarships promote excellence within certain   fields.&nbsp; High-need vocations use scholarship incentives to lure   competent prospects.&nbsp; Corporations sponsor industry-related scholarships   that ensure a well-trained workforce for the future.&nbsp; Your career   ambitions might be rewarded with undergraduate scholarship dollars that   zero in on your academic major.</p>
      <p><img src="https://www.collegescholarships.org/images/undergraduate-scholarships.jpg" width="319" height="376" alt="undergrad scholarships" class="alignright" /></p>
      <h2>Begin Your Scholarship Search</h2>
      <p>The first step toward undergraduate scholarship money is identifying   programs that are open for application.&nbsp; Some scholarship money actually   goes out to high-school and middle-school students, so it is never too   early to be proactive about securing educational aid.</p>
      <p>As you lay out your educational path for the future, the scholarships   to target will begin to stand out.&nbsp; Answer questions like these to   refine your scholarship search: Are you going for a bachelor&rsquo;s degree,   or is an associate&rsquo;s program better-suited&nbsp;to your career goals?&nbsp; Are   you attending an in-state college?&nbsp; What is your major?</p>
      <p>Scholarships&nbsp;for undergrads are open to the&nbsp;following student   groups.&nbsp; Follow application instructions precisely, and be aware of   filing deadlines and special eligibility requirements.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>High school students &ndash; especially seniors</li>
        <li>Enrolled university students</li>
        <li>Community college&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/technical-school.htm">technical college</a> students</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/homeschool.htm">Home-school</a> students</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/adult-students.htm">Adult</a>, <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/non-traditional.htm">Non-Traditional</a>, and <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/returning-students.htm">Returning</a> students</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Sponsoring Sources</h2>
      <p>A wide spectrum of&nbsp;scholarship awards originate from a diverse   collection of funding sources.&nbsp; Undergraduate scholarships are sponsored   by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Federal, State and Local Government Agencies.</li>
        <li>Colleges and Universities</li>
        <li>Corporations</li>
        <li>Professional Organizations</li>
        <li>Charitable Foundations</li>
        <li>Advocacy Groups</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Subject-Specific Scholarships</h2>
      <p>If your academic path is clear,&nbsp;then evaluate the <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/subject-specific.htm">subject-specific</a> undergraduate scholarships offered by groups associated with your field   of study. Dozens of free-money programs are specifically packaged for   students who enter certain&nbsp;fields. <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/accounting-students.htm">Accounting</a>, <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/engineering-students.htm">engineering</a> and <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/psychology-students.htm">psychology</a> are academic majors supported by subject-specific scholarships.&nbsp; And   sub-specialties within fields like engineering open even more   scholarship doors in related fields like: <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/engineering/aerospace.htm">aerospace</a>, <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/engineering/chemical.htm">chemical</a>, <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/engineering/industrial.htm">industrial</a>, <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/engineering/manufacturing.htm">manufacturing</a>, and <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/engineering/systems.htm">systems engineering</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.aicpa.org/BecomeACPA/Scholarships/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">American Institute of Certified Public Accountants</a> (AICPA)&nbsp;disburses these distinct annual scholarships for promising accounting degree candidates.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>AICPA/Accountemps Student Scholarship requires applicants to have   earned 30 hours of academic credit, with at least 6 hours in accounting   courses.&nbsp; Candidates must&nbsp;maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.0 to be   eligible for the $2500 scholarships.</li>
        <li>AICPA Scholarships for Minority Accounting Students are available   for undergraduate Blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans and Asian   Americans. Candidates must be enrolled full time, with at least 30   college credits earned.&nbsp; A 3.3 GPA is also required for eligibility.&nbsp;   The minority scholarships total $3000 each.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><a href="http://www.imanet.org/ima_home.aspx" target="_blank">Institute of Management Accountants </a>(IMA)is   a professional association representing&nbsp;accountants. Women benefit from   two special scholarships for undergraduate accounting majors. In   addition to $2000 each, winners receive the CMA Learning Systems Kit and   access to online practice tests for the CPA exam.&nbsp; A one-year student   membership to the IMA is also included with each scholarship award.</p>
      <p>Corporate sponsors use college scholarships to lift-up the next level of professionals.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.siemens-foundation.org/en/advanced_placement/about_saap.htm" target="_blank">Siemens Foundation</a> promotes engineering education and other STEM subjects through   competitive scholarship programs for high-school and undergraduate   students.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.asme.org/about-asme/scholarship-and-loans/about-asme-scholarships" target="_blank">ASME</a> administers several scholarships for mechanical engineering students.&nbsp;   Candidates are evaluated&nbsp;based on academic performance, character, need   and ASME participation.&nbsp; Scholarships are awarded annually, to students   who have&nbsp;established college-level GPA within&nbsp;mechanical engineering   majors.&nbsp; Only members of ASME may apply for the scholarships, which is   achieved by completing a single online application.</p>
      <p><a href="http://students.sae.org/awdscholar/scholarships/" target="_blank">SAE International Scholarship Program</a>&nbsp;supports   engineering students with undergraduate scholarships.&nbsp; The awards are   made possible by corporate, institutional&nbsp;and private donations.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.saefoundation.org/" target="_blank">SAE Foundation</a>&nbsp;administers   the scholarships as the charitable arm of SAE International, promoting   education within STEM subjects and increasing student participation in   engineering fields.</p>
      <p>Colleges each administer unique scholarships that only go to students enrolled there.&nbsp; Engineering students at the <a href="http://www.engr.washington.edu/curr_students/scholarships.html" target="_blank">University of Washington</a>&nbsp;compete   for over 150 scholarship funds designed to be integrated into each   student&rsquo;s total financial aid package.&nbsp; Scholarships are disbursed by   each of the Engineering School&rsquo;s ten departments, based on need and   academic performance.&nbsp; Incoming freshmen, pre-engineering students and   entering transfer students are invited to apply.</p>
      <p>At University of Texas &ndash; Austin, students at the <a href="http://www.engr.utexas.edu/undergraduate/scholarships" target="_blank">Cockrell School of Engineering</a> benefit from scholarship dollars set aside by private and&nbsp;corporate   donors.&nbsp; Applicants compete for over $4 million&nbsp;worth of&nbsp;annual   merit-based engineering awards.&nbsp; Incoming freshman, transfer students,   current enrollees and international students are eligible to apply for   scholarships, by selecting engineering as their first-choice major.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.nspe.org/Students/Scholarships/index.html#ug" target="_blank">National Society of Professional Engineers </a>prods   the profession forward by sponsoring several undergraduate   scholarships.&nbsp; Some memorial awards are reserved for specific student   groups like women (Auxiliary Legacy Scholarship), Kansas residents   (William Kimel Scholarship) and juniors (Steinman Scholarship).</p>
      <p>Universities issue scholarship money through the individual departments that administer the funds.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.psych.ucla.edu/undergraduate/services/scholarships" target="_blank">The UCLA Psychology Department</a>&nbsp;is   responsible for a number of career-specific undergraduate scholarships;   including summer school and research funding.&nbsp; One such award, the John   Seward Scholarship, rewards high-achieving undergraduates studying   Psychology, Psycho-biology and Cognitive Science.&nbsp; Applicants conducting   undergraduate research in the areas of learning, motivation and   behavioral psychology are eligible for $400 each,&nbsp;based on the quality   of the research paper presented.<img src="https://www.collegescholarships.org/images/undergrad-scholarships.jpg" width="289" height="415" alt="undergraduate scholarships" class="alignright" /></p>
      <h2>Student-Specific Scholarships</h2>
      <p>Undergraduate scholarships also target individual student groups   based on ethnic diversity, disability, gender and a host of other   personal characteristics.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/student-specific.htm">Student-specific</a> scholarships strive to increase educational access for   under-represented groups, and provide a leg-up for disadvantaged members   of the student body. These student-specific categories represent a   wealth of targeted financial aid dollars for diverse undergraduates:&nbsp; <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/first-in-family.htm">First in family</a>, <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/international-students.htm">international students</a>, <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/lgbt-students.htm">LGBT</a>, <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/low-income.htm">low-income</a>, <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/military-students.htm">military</a>, <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/other-minority-scholarships.htm">minority</a>, and students <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/countries-culture.htm">studying abroad</a>.</p>
      <p>Women can apply for some scholarships that are not available to their   male counterparts -which is like eliminating half the competition   before the contest begins.&nbsp; For example, female accounting students are   eligible for special scholarship awards put forth by the <a href="http://www.efwa.org/scholarships.php" target="_blank">Educational Foundation for Women in Accounting</a>.&nbsp; The group has been empowering women with college scholarships since 1966.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Women in Transition Scholarships serve women who are starting   bachelor&rsquo;s degree level accounting programs.&nbsp; Applicants must provide   the primary means of family support and be enrolled as incoming   freshman.&nbsp; The scholarship can be worth as much as $16,000 toward a   four-year accounting education.</li>
        <li>Sophomore&rsquo;s apply for Women in Need scholarships that award $2000 initially, and can be renewed for two additional years.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/other-minority-scholarships.htm">Minority</a>&nbsp;groups   are rewarded&nbsp;with scholarships that take ethnic, racial, and cultural   diversity into consideration. Advocacy groups use grants and   scholarships to&nbsp;boost the presence of under-represented students in   college.</p>
      <p>African American students studying STEM subjects are in-line for undergraduate scholarship dollars from Microsoft.&nbsp; &ldquo;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/about/diversity/en/us/programs/blacks-scholarships.aspx" target="_blank">Blacks at Microsoft</a>&rdquo;   is a generous minority scholarship program that distributes two $5000   scholarship awards annually.&nbsp; High-school seniors who will be studying   engineering, science and math at four-year colleges are invited to apply   &ndash; provided they have maintained high-school grade point averages above   3.3.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.apiasf.org/" target="_blank">Asian and Pacific Islander American Scholarship Fund</a> is the largest source for undergraduate scholarships for students of   Asian descent. As well as their own signature scholarships, APIASF   partners with outside donors to administer additional scholarship   funds.&nbsp; Graduating seniors, community college students and Asian   Americans seeking bachelor&rsquo;s degrees are eligible to apply.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.collegefund.org/" target="_blank">American Indian Scholarship Fund</a> helps Native Americans graduate from college.&nbsp; The Fund is an important   resource for this under-represented group, allowing countless students   to embrace higher education.&nbsp; Tribal Colleges promote self-esteem and   cultural identity, so Native American scholarships are weighted heavily   toward students who choose this educational path.</p>
