<h2>College Funding Assistance Comes from State Programs</h2>
	  	  
<p>The men and women who serve in the United States Military make   remarkable sacrifices for their country. But the sacrifices of their   families, particularly their children, often get overlooked. Children   with a parent in the military may spend much of their childhood with an   absent mother or father. Even when the family is not separated, children   may spend a large portion of their school years moving from military   base to military base, changing schools with each new deployment.</p>
<p>While there is no way to truly repay the service given the country by   military personnel and their families, at the very least it is possible   to provide financial assistance to those military children who are   struggling to meet the rising costs of college tuition. Providing   scholarships for the children of military service-personnel is one small   way in which the people of the United States say thank you to the   dedicated members of the armed forces and their families.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.collegescholarships.org/images/military-children-scholarships.jpg" width="421" height="285" class="aligncenter" alt="military scholarships" /></p>
<h2>College Funding Assistance Comes from State Programs</h2>
<p>Each state in the country has a department of higher education, and   an office of veterans affairs. Most states offer some form of financial   aid for the college aged children of military service-members. State   sponsored scholarships are common for the children of active-duty,   retired and deceased military personnel. Each state will offer its own   programs, and each program will have its own distinctive set of   requirements. Students are encouraged to contact their state&rsquo;s   Department of Higher Education, or Office of Veteran&rsquo;s Affairs, to learn   about scholarship programs for which they may be eligible.</p>
<p>The following selection of state supported scholarships for the   children of military service-members will give students an idea of the   types of programs that may be available in their state.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="https://va.iowa.gov/benefits/war_orphans.html" target="_blank">Iowa War Orphans Scholarship</a> provides financial assistance to the children of military personnel who   were killed in combat. Applicants must have maintained an Iowa   residency for at least 2 years, and must be enrolled at an approved   state college, university or technical school. The annual award is $600.   Students may reapply every year in which they meet eligibility   requirements. Total lifetime awards can not exceed $3000.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.mdva.state.mn.us/education/SurvivingSpouseDependentInformationSheet.pdf" target="_blank">Minnesota State War Orphans Education Program</a> provides tuition assistance to the biological or adopted children of   military servicemen and women who have been killed in combat, or who   have died as a result of wounds received while in combat. Applicants   must be current residents of Minnesota, and must be attending an   approved state college, university or technical school. Annual awards   are $750. The scholarships is non-renewable, though students may reapply   every year in which they meet eligibility requirements.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://montanadma.org/" target="_blank">Montana Department of Military Affairs</a> supports a number of programs for the dependent children of military service personnel.Current programs include<strong><em> Scholarships for the Dependents of POW/MIA&rsquo;s</em></strong> and <strong><em>Scholarships for the Children of Deceased Veterans</em></strong>. Applicants must be residents of Montana, and must be enrolled at an accredited state college or university.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.tvc.texas.gov/Hazlewood-Act.aspx" target="_blank">Texas Hazlewood Act</a> provides up to 150 hours of tuition assistance to the dependent   children of military veterans who were killed while on active duty.   Applicants must be residents of the state of Texas, and must be between   the ages of 18 and 25. To be eligible, students must not be receiving   any other Federal Veteran Education Benefits.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Scholarship Opportunities Direct from the Armed Forces</h2>
<p>Each branch of the United States Military offers scholarship, grants   and tuition assistance for their enlisted personnel. Much of this   financial aid also extends to the dependent children of active-duty,   retired, disabled and deceased service-members. The following examples   highlight the variety of programs directly supported by the armed forces   themselves.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://gibill.va.gov/benefits/other_programs/dea.html" target="_blank">Survivors and Dependents Assistance Program</a> is supported by the U.S. Army, and offers financial assistance to the   dependent children of Army personnel who have been killed or disabled in   the line of duty. The program also provides financial aid to children   of personnel listed as missing in action, or declared prisoners of war.   The program provides 45 hours of tuition assistance to eligible students   enrolled in approved undergraduate, graduate or vocational studies.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.afas.org/Education/ArnoldEdGrant.cfm" target="_blank">General Henry H. Arnold Education Grant Program</a> provides financial assistance to the college-bound children of   active-duty and retired Air Force personnel. Awards are determined on   the basis of need. Maximum grant allowances currently stand at $2000.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.hqafsa.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Scholarships1&amp;Template=/CM/HTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=6875" target="_blank">Scholarship for Air Force Enlisted Member&rsquo;s Dependent Children</a> is supported by the <em><strong>Air Force Sergeants Association</strong></em> and the <em><strong>Airmen Memorial Foundation</strong></em>.   The program provides scholarships to the children of active-duty,   retired and veteran Air Force personnel. Awards are determined by   academic achievement, and community service. Scholarship amounts range   from $500 to $3000.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.nmcrs.org/goldstar.pdf" target="_blank">NMCRS Gold Star Scholarship</a> is supported by the Navy-Marine Corp Relief Society. The scholarship   program provides financial assistance to the children of Navy and Marine   personnel who were killed in the line of duty. Applicants must   demonstrate the requisite level of financial need, and must have a   minimum 2.0 GPA. Awards range from $500 to $2500 per academic year.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.militaryscholar.org/sfmc/index.html" target="_blank">Scholarships for Military Children Program</a> provides scholarships to the children of active-duty, retired, deceased   or reservist military personnel. The program is administered through   the commissaries of military bases around the world. Each commissary   awards one $1500 scholarship per year. Eligible students must be under   the age of 21, and must be enrolled full time at an accredited college   or university.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://freedomalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Fry_scholarship_info.pdf" target="_blank">Post 9/11 G.I. Bill &amp; Marine Gunnery Sgt. John David Fry Scholarship</a> is sponsored in cooperation with the <a href="http://freedomalliance.org/" target="_blank">Freedom Alliance</a>.   The scholarship provides educational benefits to the children of   military personnel who were killed, or disabled, in the line of duty   after September 10, 2001. Awards amounts vary, and can be applied at any   accredited college, university or technical school.</li>
</ul>
<p>The sacrifices made by military families can only really be   understood by those who have experienced them. As outsiders we can   sympathize, but never totally empathize, with the challenges they face   on a regular basis. Scholarships, grants and tuition assistance programs   are a small way of paying tribute to the dedication and selflessness of   military servicemen and women, and their families.</p>
<p>The financial aid programs discussed here are only a sampling of the   education benefits available to the dependent children of military   personnel. Students can find more information through their college&rsquo;s   office of financial aid, and through their state&rsquo;s Office of Veteran&rsquo;s   Affairs.</p>
