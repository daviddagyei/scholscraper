      <h2>How to Find Free Money for Your Particular Educational Needs </h2>
      <p>Very few students are in a position to pay for college out of pocket.   Even those students whose parents had the foresight to open a college   savings account, and who have participated in a <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/529-savings.htm">529 savings plan</a>,   are still likely to need some degree of financial aid to totally cover   the costs of tuition, books, lab fees and housing. College is a costly   proposition, and many students look to scholarships to help fill any   gaps in their education fund. But scholarships are as diverse as the   students who need them, and it can sometimes be difficult to find the   scholarship that is right for you.</p>
      <p>Like college students themselves, scholarships come in a variety of   shapes and sizes. Undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral students each   have specific financial needs. While there are some general scholarship   programs that may be applicable to all students, the majority will be   specific to student type and will only be available to students at a   particular level of their college career. It is not uncommon for first   time scholarship seekers to track down a promising program, only to find   that they are ineligible because they are not at the specified degree   level. In addition to degree level, many scholarships are designed to   target students pursuing a specific major or course of study. These   subject-specific awards make up a large part of the scholarship field,   and students with definite career goals are likely to have better luck   in their search for scholarship opportunities.</p>
      <p><img src="https://www.collegescholarships.org/images/scholarships-by-degree.jpg" width="425" class="aligncenter" height="282" alt="scholarships by degree level" /></p>
      <p>Finding the right scholarship to suit your educational needs can   sometimes seem daunting, but it really needn&rsquo;t be. We&rsquo;ve prepared the   following general overview to help students become more familiar with   the types of scholarship programs that are available. Hopefully, this   information will help students at every degree level identify the types   of scholarship programs that are best suited to their status and   educational goals.</p>
      <h2>Undergraduate Scholarships</h2>
      <p>College undergraduates make up the largest portion of the national   student body, and as such are the largest group of students actively   searching for scholarships. Most undergraduates have yet to declare a   major, and are searching for general <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/undergraduate-students.htm">merit-based or need-based scholarships</a> to help them pay for their college education. Even students who have a   definite field of study in mind may choose to change majors during their   first couple of years in college. This is not unusual, but it does make   general scholarships the preferred option for students at the   undergraduate level.</p>
      <p>Undergraduate scholarships apply to the following student types:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>High School juniors and seniors</li>
        <li>Enrolled university students in their freshman, sophomore, or junior year</li>
        <li>Students enrolled in a community college, technical college, or vocational school</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/adult-students.htm">Adult</a>, <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/non-traditional.htm">non-traditional</a>, or <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/returning-students.htm">returning students</a></li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Best Scholarship Selections for Undergraduates</h3>
      <p>Undergraduates with clear educational goals may want to look beyond   the general purpose scholarship programs, and refine their search by   concentrating on <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/subject-specific.htm">subject-specific awards</a>, <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/athletic.htm">athletic scholarships</a>, or <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/countries-culture.htm">scholarships for students planning to study abroad</a>.   Undergraduates who have already decided on a specific educational path   may find that these highly targeted scholarships offer more   opportunities than the more general programs.</p>
      <p>Many scholarships target specific student types, and can be a   valuable source of funding for undergraduates who meet the program&rsquo;s   criteria. These <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/student-specific.htm">student specific scholarships</a> target undergraduates from a wide range of backgrounds, and often   address the needs of students in specific circumstances. Some of the   more common scholarships based on student type include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Students with <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/disabilities.htm">disabilities</a> or <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/medical-conditions.htm">health issues</a></li>
        <li>Students from religious backgrounds</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/fraternity.htm">Fraternity</a> and <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/sorority.htm">Sorority</a> members</li>
        <li>Students in unique or extreme circumstances (<a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/foster.htm">foster children</a>, <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/military-students.htm">military dependents</a>, etc.)</li>
        <li>Students involved in clubs or community service</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Popular Scholarships for Women and Minority Undergraduates</h3>
      <p>Women and ethnic minorities have a history of being under-represented   in the United State&rsquo;s university system. Many scholarship programs are   designed to redress this imbalance, and to encourage more women and   minorities to pursue a post-secondary education. Scholarships for   students pursuing degrees in the STEM fields (<a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/physical-life.htm">science</a>, <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/it-students.htm">technology</a>, <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/engineering-students.htm">engineering</a> and <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/math-students.htm">mathematics</a>) are particularly plentiful for minority students.</p>
      <p>For the purposes of scholarship applications, <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/other-minority-scholarships.htm">minority students</a> include the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/women.htm">Women</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/resc_minority.html">African-Americans</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/asian.htm">Asian-Americans</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/minority2.htm">Hispanic-Americans</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/nativeamerican.htm">Native Americans</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/lgbt-students.htm">Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgendered</a></li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Common Sources of Scholarship Funding for Undergraduates</h3>
      <p>Scholarship programs for undergraduates are funded by a wide variety of sources, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Federal Government</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/states.htm"> State Governments</a></li>
        <li>Colleges and Universities</li>
        <li>Corporations and Private Industry</li>
        <li>Professional Associations</li>
        <li>Charitable Foundations and Advocacy Groups</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Free Money for Graduate Students</h2>
      <p>Graduate students have different financial needs than their   undergraduate counterparts. At this point in a college career, a   student&rsquo;s educational path should be firmly set, and general scholarship   programs will have fallen by the wayside. Students heading into a   Master&rsquo;s degree program will be searching for <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/graduate-students.htm">graduate school scholarships</a> that target their specific field of study. Typical disciplines that offer graduate level scholarship opportunities include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Architecture</li>
        <li>Business</li>
        <li>Law</li>
        <li>Science</li>
        <li>Mathematics</li>
        <li>Engineering</li>
        <li>Healthcare</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Finding Graduate Student Scholarships</h3>
      <p>In our section on <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/subject-specific.htm">subject-specific scholarships</a>,   students will find a comprehensive list of the most common college   level fields of study. This list can be used to access detailed   information on scholarship programs dedicated to that discipline. In   many cases, that information will include details on sub-specialties,   allowing graduate students to refine their scholarship search even   further. For example, a graduate student might follow a link from the   subject-specific scholarship list to the section on engineering   scholarships, which will in turn provide links to more specific   engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, environmental   engineering, and computer sciences. Use this resource as a stepping   stone to more specific information on graduate level scholarships for   students in your field.</p>
      <h3>Graduate Scholarships for Women and Minorities</h3>
      <p>Over the last few decades a concerted effort has been made to   diversify the national student body, and to encourage women and   minorities to pursue their college education at a higher level. A wide   range of graduate level scholarships are available to women and   minorities, particular in the critical need STEM fields of science,   technology, engineering and mathematics. Minority students will also   find a large number of graduate level scholarships dedicated to law,   medicine, and nursing.</p>
      <h3>Micro-Specialized Grad Degrees Lead to Finer Scholarships</h3>
      <p>Graduate level students typically have their career goals already   mapped out, and are working towards a micro-specialized degree that will   take them into the professional world. This micro-specialization can be   used to fine tune a scholarship search in order to find specific   programs that will help graduate students pursue their ultimate career   goals. For example, a student looking for graduate level business   scholarships is likely to have already chosen a specific sub-discipline   such as <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/business/forensic-accounting.htm">forensic accounting</a>, <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/business/marketing.htm">marketing</a> or <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/business/pr.htm">public relations</a>.   Graduate students should refine their search for scholarships by   including any micro-specialization that further delineates their career   goals within a field of study.</p>
      <h3>Sources of Scholarship Funding for Graduate Level Students</h3>
      <p>Graduate level scholarships are by their nature subject-specific, and   subsequently the sources of funding will be more closely allied to the   student&rsquo;s field of study. The most common sources of graduate level   scholarships include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Colleges and Universities</li>
        <li>Corporations and Private Industry</li>
        <li>Professional Associations and Organizations</li>
        <li>Advocacy Groups</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Strategies for Finding Doctoral Scholarships</h2>
      <p>Scholarships for Doctoral students generally take the form of   university fellowships that cover all tuition costs, and that provide a   yearly stipend to cover housing and essentials. Fellowship programs are   designed to provide the financial support a student needs to complete   their research and to prepare their dissertation. In exchange for this   support, the student may be required to act as an adjunct instructor or   research assistant. Fellowship programs do more than supply the much   needed funds a student needs to complete their education. University   fellowships give Doctoral students the opportunity to put their years of   learning into practice, while engaging in the research necessary to   complete a Doctoral degree.</p>
      <p>Post-Graduate students searching for a fellowship should begin with a <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/subject-specific.htm">subject-specific search</a>,   and then refine their search by sub-discipline. Fellowships for   Doctoral students are highly competitive, but students will find that   many universities and professional associations offer highly lucrative   fellowship opportunities for <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/doctoral-students.htm">Doctoral candidates</a>.</p>
      <h3>Popular Scholarships for PhD Candidates</h3>
      <p>Fellowships for PhD candidates are directly linked to the student&rsquo;s   field of research. Some of the more popular disciplines offering   fellowships for Doctoral students include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Astronomy</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/physical-life.htm">Physical and Life Sciences</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/social-sciences.htm">Social Sciences</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/social-worker.htm">Social Work and Counseling</a></li>
        <li>History and Liberal Arts</li>
        <li>Education</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/law-students.htm">Law</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/health-science.htm">Medicine</a></li>
      </ul>
