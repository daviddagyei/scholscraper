      <h2>   Best Vet Scholarships from National Organizations and Colleges   </h2>
	  
<p>Becoming a veterinarian requires much more than just a love of   animals. People tend to forget that veterinarians are licensed doctors,   and like all medical professionals must complete a long and intense   course of studies before they can be certified to practice. Veterinary   school takes time and determination, and students must master a diverse   number of disciplines including chemistry, biology, anatomy, and   mathematics. Veterinarians are highly educated and highly skilled   individuals who must be prepared to diagnose and treat a wide array of   animals, from house pets to farm animals. It is a highly challenging   profession. Studying to become a veterinarian can be expensive,   fortunately there are a wide range of scholarship opportunities   available specifically designed to help veterinary students pay for   their college education.</p>
<p>Scholarships for veterinary students are supported by a variety of   sources. Many corporations closely allied to the pet-care industry   sponsor annual scholarships for students pursuing careers in veterinary   medicine. National organizations dedicated to the care and support of   animals are also prime sources for college funding. <img src="https://www.collegescholarships.org/images/vet-scholarships.jpg" class="alignright" width="387" height="310" alt="vet scholarships" /></p>
<p>Scholarships for   veterinary students are highly competitive, and only the best and   brightest will be awarded the funds they need to pay for their   education. While students wishing to become veterinarians may not have   the pick of the litter when it comes to scholarships, they may be   surprised at just how many opportunities are out there for hard working   veterinary students.</p>
<h2>National Scholarships</h2>
<p>Many national organizations sponsor valuable scholarships for   veterinary students. Some of these programs are funded by corporations   with close ties to the animal-care industry, while others are sponsored   by professional associations concerned with the care and well-being of   both domesticated and wild animals. The wide range of national   scholarship opportunities is indicative of the varied duties and   responsibilities of a practicing veterinarian.</p>
<p>As with all scholarships, eligibility requirements and award amounts   will vary greatly amongst the available programs. Students are   encouraged to research any scholarship program thoroughly in order to be   prepared to meet all eligibility requirements. The following examples   of nationally sponsored scholarships will illustrate the types of   financial aid opportunities that are available to veterinary students.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://classic.akc.org/index.cfm?nav_area=homepage" target="_blank">American Kennel Club</a> is devoted the well-being of all pure-bred domesticated dogs. The <a href="http://classic.akc.org/vetoutreach/aboutus_2.cfm" target="_blank">AKC Veterinary Student Scholarship</a> is supported by funding from the AKC Companion Animal Recovery, Royal   Canin, and the AKC Canine Health Foundation. Scholarships are awarded on   the basis of academic achievement, and a history of research into the   needs of purebred dogs. Eligible students must be enrolled full time at   an accredited veterinary school. The maximum award amount is $10,000.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.hennet.org/home.php?PHPSESSID=6c3320d58c77f807f87f6120f30ff575" target="_blank">Humane Education Network</a> is dedicated to the ethical treatment of all animal species. The   foundation sponsors an annual essay writing contest, with an award of   $1000. While not strictly a scholarship, the <a href="http://www.hennet.org/contest.php#scholarship" target="_blank">Voice for Animals Contest</a> provides a valuable opportunity to high school students interested in   pursuing a career in veterinary medicine by awarding funds which may be   applied at any accredited veterinary school.</li>

</ul>
<h2>College Specific Scholarships</h2>
<p>One of the prime sources of scholarship funds for veterinary students   is their own college of attendance. Many veterinary schools sponsor, or   administer, scholarships for deserving students pursuing careers in   veterinary medicine. Some of these programs may be funded by private   endowments, or through the generosity of local and national   organizations.</p>
<p>The following scholarships are good examples of the types of   financial aid programs available at specific colleges of veterinary   medicine around the country.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://vet.tufts.edu/" target="_blank">Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine</a> at Tufts University supports a variety of scholarships for its enrolled students.<a href="http://vet.tufts.edu/financial_aid/sources/annual_scholarships.html" target="_blank"> 14 annual scholarships</a> and more than <a href="http://vet.tufts.edu/financial_aid/sources/endowed_scholarships.html" target="_blank">30 endowed scholarships</a> are available to high performing veterinary students. Eligibility   requirements range from financial need to specialized course of study,   with some scholarships being specifically targeted to women and   minorities entering the field of veterinary medicine. Some of the more   popular programs include the <em><strong>Cats, Plain and Fancy Scholarship</strong></em>, the <em><strong>John F. and Georgia O&rsquo;Neill Flagg Scholarship for Wildlife Medicine</strong></em>, the <em><strong>Bil-Jac Foods Inc. Scholarship</strong></em> and the <em><strong>Westminster Kennel Club Foundation Scholarship</strong></em>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://csu-cvmbs.colostate.edu/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">College of Veterinary Medicine &amp; Biomedical Sciences</a> at Colorado State University administers a number of scholarships for its attending students. A wide range of <a href="http://csu-cvmbs.colostate.edu/Documents/awards-undergraduate.pdf" target="_blank">undergraduate scholarships</a> are available, including the <em><strong>John R.

Gearhart Memorial Scholarship</strong></em> and the <em><strong>Kingman Integrated Livestock Management Scholarship</strong></em>. Application for graduate level scholarships is by faculty nomination only.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.cvhs.okstate.edu/" target="_blank">Center for Veterinary Health Sciences</a> at Oklahoma State University offers its students a variety of financial aid opportunities. OSU awards a number of <a href="https://financialaid.okstate.edu/types-of-aid-home/109-types-of-aid-scholarshipswaivers" target="_blank">scholarships and tuition waivers</a> for both undergraduate and graduate students. Eligibility is determined   by academic achievement, major, field of specialization and financial   need. Award amounts vary.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://vet.uga.edu/" target="_blank">University of Georgia College of Veterinary Medicine</a> provides scholarships for attending students at every level of their   college career. In conjunction with the American Veterinary Medical   Foundation, UGA offers scholarships for <a href="http://www.vet.uga.edu/academic_affairs_files/pdf/year1.pdf" target="_blank">1st year</a>, <a href="http://www.vet.uga.edu/academic_affairs_files/pdf/year2.pdf" target="_blank">2nd year</a>, <a href="http://www.vet.uga.edu/academic_affairs_files/pdf/year3.pdf" target="_blank">3rd year</a> and <a href="http://www.vet.uga.edu/academic_affairs_files/pdf/year4.pdf" target="_blank">4th year</a> students.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Regional Scholarships</h2>
<p>Veterinary students residing in states with large rural or farming   communities often have access to regional scholarship funds designed to   increase the availability of licensed veterinarians within the area.   Typically, these programs will only be available to students from a   particular state or region of the country, and may require that students   agree to work as a licensed veterinarian in a critical need rural   community.</p>
<p>The following scholarships are typical of the types of regional   financial aid programs that are available to students studying   veterinary medicine.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://veterinaryscholarshiptrust.org/site/view/158567_AbouttheTrust.pml" target="_blank">Veterinary Scholarship Trust of New England</a> provides annual scholarship opportunities to veterinary students from   Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and   Connecticut. A large number of scholarships are awarded every year, with   funding being provided by state veterinary associations, canine and   equine groups and individual endowments.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.rivma.org/members/RIVMA%20Scholarship%20app.pdf" target="_blank">Rhode Island Veterinary Medical Association</a> sponsors a $1000 scholarship for veterinary students entering their   senior year of college. To be eligible, students must be a graduate of a   Rhode Island high school, and must have a minimum GPA of 2.5.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.wvc.org/" target="_blank">Western Veterinary Conference</a> awards 32 annual $2500 scholarships to veterinary students in their   third year of studies. To be eligible, students must be enrolled at an   accredited college of veterinary medicine within the United States or   Canada.</li>
</ul>
<p>Becoming a licensed veterinarian takes years of study, and a profound   dedication to the welfare of all animals. It is a challenging career   that requires an ability to both understand and treat animals in   distress, and to communicate with and counsel the animals owners.   Veterinary medicine offers many rewards, both financial and emotional.   For students considering a career in veterinary medicine, the right   scholarship can help pave the way to a successful practice.      </p>
