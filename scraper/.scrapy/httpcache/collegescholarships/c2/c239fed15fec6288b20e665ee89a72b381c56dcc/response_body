      <h2> Getting Student Education Tax Breaks     </h2>
	  
<p>The American Opportunity Tax Credit, formerly the Hope credit, and   the lifetime learning credit are both tax credits that you can claim on   your federal tax return. The goal is to help defray the cost of   education by reducing your income tax obligation, and if you do not   qualify for either credit (as discussed below) you can opt for the   tuition and fees deduction, which applies to higher education only and   can subtract as much as $4,000 from your taxable income.</p>
<p>For each student in your family, you may claim only one of those   three tax breaks each year, so you will have to choose among the three.<img src="https://www.collegescholarships.org/images/tax-credits.jpg" class="alignright" width="283" height="424" alt="tax credits for financial aid" /></p>
<h2>American Opportunity Tax Credit</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.irs.gov/uac/American-Opportunity-Tax-Credit" target="_blank">American Opportunity Tax Credit</a> (AOTC) was an expansion of the Hope credit passed as part of the 2009   stimulus package (the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act). It was   due to expire in 2013 but fortunately was rescued in legislative   negotiations, and is now guaranteed through 2017. That is good news for   taxpayers, because more families are eligible for AOTC as compared to   Hope.</p>
<p>In general, AOTC has a higher family income limit and applies to   families that do not owe tax. Specifically, the income limits are   $80,000 (for an individual) and $160,000 (two spouses) in what the IRS   calls <a href="http://ssa-custhelp.ssa.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/1601/%7E/calculation-of-modified-adjusted-gross-income-%28magi%29" target="_blank">modified adjusted gross income</a> (MAGI), which appears on your IRS Form 1040. And the AOTC permits you   to claim the credit for four years of higher education, whereas Hope   lasted for only two.</p>
<p>The AOTC offsets expenses paid out for not only tuition but also some   of your fees and course materials, like books, equipment, or laboratory   supplies. The maximum annual credit allowable by way of AOTC is $2,500,   40% of which can be given back to you as a tax refund up to a maximum   of $1,000. There is also a <a href="http://www.irs.gov/uac/American-Opportunity-Tax-Credit:-Questions-and-Answers" target="_blank">list</a> of expenses that are not considered qualified, such as room and board,   insurance, and any student fees not necessary to enroll in or attend   school.</p>
<p>Most, if not all, of your acceptable expenses will be recorded on   your IRS Form 1098-T, which you can request from your school. AOTC can   be claimed for four years, but remember that includes any years in which   you claimed the former Hope credit. Finally, there are other   restrictions on the use of AOTC.</p>
<p>For example, any courses for which you claim credit must contribute   toward your acquisition of either a degree or some other type of   postsecondary credentials. That is not true for the lifetime learning   credit, and the lifetime learning credit is extended to students who   have felony drug convictions, whereas AOTC bars those students. AOTC   requires that a student attend at least half-time, and as little as one   course is acceptable for the lifetime learning credit.</p>
<p>Finally, AOTC states that you must not have completed your first four   years of higher education as of the beginning of the tax year.</p>
<h2>Lifetime Learning Credit</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.irs.gov/publications/p970/ch03.html" target="_blank">lifetime learning credit</a> has income limits of $61,000 (individual) and $122,000 (two spouses) in   MAGI. There is no limit on the number of years for which you can claim   the credit. Unlike AOTC, the credit is not refundable, meaning you will   not receive any money back after taking it (although it can bring your   tax liability down to zero).</p>
<p>Any year of education past the high school level is eligible for the   lifetime learning credit, including courses you take to enhance your job   skills even if they do not lead to a degree or certificate.</p>
<p>The most you can claim annually under the lifetime learning credit is   $2,000. As discussed, the eligibility criteria for the lifetime   learning credit are quite loose as compared to AOTC, but there are still   a few special guidelines that claimants must follow:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You cannot be a married person filing a separate tax return.</li>
  <li>You cannot be a dependent on someone else&rsquo;s tax return.</li>
  <li>During the tax year, if either you or your spouse qualified as a   nonresident alien the person so qualifying must be treated as a resident   alien for tax purposes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Higher Education Tuition and Fees Deduction</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.irs.gov/publications/p970/ch06.html" target="_blank">Higher Education Tuition and Fees deduction</a> has been extended through December 31, 2013, thanks to the American   Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. After that date, be sure to check with the   IRS for the current status of the deduction, which is the third way to   derive some tax benefit from your higher education expenses.</p>
<p>Itemization is not required in order to use it, and that is because it is a tax <em>deduction</em> (a way to lower the amount of your taxable income) rather than a tax   credit, such as AOTC or the lifetime learning credit. The limits on MAGI   are the same as those for AOTC ($80,000 and $160,000), and the person   for whom the deduction is claimed must be one of the following: you,   your spouse, or a dependent on your tax return for whom you also claim   an exemption.</p>
<p>Eligible expenses include your tuition plus any fees you must pay in   order to attend, but not any personal expenses like housing or food.</p>
