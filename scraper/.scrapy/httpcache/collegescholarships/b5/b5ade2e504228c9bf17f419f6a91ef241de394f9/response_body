      <h2> Scholarships for Doctoral Students    </h2>
	  


         <p>Undergraduate tuition and other expenses associated   with&nbsp;earning certificates, associate&rsquo;s&nbsp;and bachelor&rsquo;s degrees create   financial hurdles for college families.&nbsp; Solutions for funding higher   education at the baccalaureate level&nbsp;include <a href="http://studentaid.ed.gov/types/grants-scholarships/pell" target="_blank">Pell Grants</a> and federally-sponsored <a href="http://www.direct.ed.gov/" target="_blank">Direct Student Loans</a>.&nbsp;   For students who forge-onward to earn advanced credentials, education   debt challenges continue to mount during graduate school and beyond.</p>
      <p>Like undergrads, professional students and doctoral candidates rely   on a variety of financial aid provisions to help meet education   expenses.&nbsp; The <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/grants/federal.htm">Federal Government</a> is a prime source of aid for post-graduate education financing.&nbsp; State   departments of education also bolster access to master&rsquo;s and PhD studies   by issuing <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/grants/state.htm">state-specific aid</a> for advanced studies.</p>
         <p>Private scholarships are issued by sources that each have unique   intentions for their educational funding contributions.&nbsp; Foundations and   religious entities put forth graduate school aid for students enrolled   in certain programs.&nbsp; Community groups and local businesses support   future leaders using educational subsidies that help train doctoral   students. Professional organizations, representing particular vocations,   foster excellence in their fields by funding advanced education.&nbsp;   Similarly, employers invest in educating people who work for them,   ensuring steady flows of well-trained human resources.<img src="https://www.collegescholarships.org/images/post-graduate-funding.jpg" class="alignright" width="283" height="424" alt="post graduate funds for college" /></p>
         <p>Universities and degree-granting institutions of higher education   control large pools of financial aid for graduate students.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Endowments and fellowships provide valuable resources for eligible   candidates, so your chosen campus is square-one for post-graduate   student assistance.</p>
         <h2>Federal Help</h2>
         <p><a href="http://studentaid.ed.gov/types/loans/plus" target="_blank">Federal PLUS Loans</a> are issued to graduate students&nbsp;who have demonstrable financial need   paying for graduate school.&nbsp;The loan initiative is an extension of the   Federal Direct Student Loan Program, so the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/" target="_blank">U.S. Department of Education</a> is the lender for PLUS loans.&nbsp; PLUS loans are available in amounts up   to the total of the cost of each successful applicant&rsquo;s tuition.&nbsp; Low   fixed interest rates for qualified borrowers are currently around 7.9%.&nbsp;   Adverse credit entries work against your eligibility for PLUS loans, so   remember that credit counts when it comes to this form of federal aid.</p>
         <p>Securing any form of federal student assistance starts&nbsp;by filing a   standardized request form with the Department of Education.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/" target="_blank">Free Application for Federal Student Assistance</a> (FAFSA) is a familiar form for undergraduates who have participated in Pell,<a href="http://www2.ed.gov/programs/fseog/index.html" target="_blank"> FSEOG</a>,   Direct Loans and other federally-sponsored college aid initiatives.&nbsp;   The protocol is the same for graduate students as for undergrads: <strong>Always file your FAFSA well before the final deadline</strong>.&nbsp;   States that use the FAFSA as a financial discovery tool impose their   own unique filing deadlines, so consider where your money is coming from   as you establish your financial aid timetable.&nbsp; Filing early leaves   time for you to make corrections and to submit additional documentation   that may be required to clarify your aid request.</p>
         <p>An important distinction exists for many graduate level students:   Most advanced degree seekers file the FAFSA as independent applicants.&nbsp;   The declaration means parents&rsquo; financial status is not considered as   part of the&nbsp;financial aid formula that decides who gets what.&nbsp; As a   result, cash strapped graduate students often&nbsp;secure larger financial   aid awards based on their individual fiscal standings.</p>
         <h2>University Fellowships Fund Education for Many PhD Candidates</h2>
         <p>Graduate universities are primary sources for scholarship funds.   Colleges are aware that advanced degrees cost money, but they also want   to attract the best available talent to attend their schools.&nbsp; As a   result, institutions of higher learning initiate scholarships and other   financial aid efforts to bring desirable academic candidates into their   doctoral programs.</p>
         <p>The sticker-price of your graduate school education is mitigated by   campus-specific aid programs including scholarships, grants and loans.   In addition to familiar undergraduate-types of aid, graduate   students&nbsp;employed on campus use fellowships and teaching assistant   positions to earn valuable tuition offsets that ease the financial   impact of training for specialized careers.</p>
         <p><a href="http://www.college.columbia.edu/students/fellowships" target="_blank">Columbia College in the City of New York</a>&nbsp;uses   its Office of Global Programs to help students land graduate school   fellowships.&nbsp; Two full-time staffers are charged with matching students   with financial opportunities that help them advance their academic,   intellectual, and professional goals.&nbsp; The group specializes in   preparing candidates for interviews and helps students find   less-traveled avenues for financial assistance.</p>
         <p><a href="http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/research/fellowships/" target="_blank">Harry Ransom Center</a> at the University of Texas at Austin issues about 50 fellowships   annually, to students who need on-site access to the school&rsquo;s extensive   collections of humanities artifacts.&nbsp; Collections of classic literature,   photographs and art are house on campus alongside significant&nbsp;film,   music and culturally historic pieces.&nbsp; Each fellowship ranges from 1-3   months, with $3000 stipends awarded for each month of research   conducted.</p>
         <p>The Lilly Library, at <a href="http://www.iub.edu/" target="_blank">Indiana University</a> in Bloomington hosts several visiting fellowships for students interested in the school&rsquo;s collections of rare books and other materials.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/%7Eliblilly/fellowships.shtml#helm" target="_blank">Mendel Fellowships and Everett Helm Fellowships</a>&nbsp;grant access to historical collections of prized literature related to exploration, education and religion.</p>
         <h2>Doctoral Scholarships in Academic and Research Fields</h2>
         <p>Graduate work is primarily research related, which requires time and   access to the materials to be studied.&nbsp; To help ease financial strain   during advanced research work, private sources&nbsp;cooperate with   educational institutions to provide&nbsp;scholarships and fellowships for   needy researchers.&nbsp;Broad aid is provided&nbsp;within fields like <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/social-sciences.htm">social sciences</a>, but focused fellowships also target specialties like <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/social-science/econ.htm">economics</a>, <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/social-science/linguistics.htm">linguistics</a>, and <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/social-science/middle-east.htm">middle eastern studies</a>&nbsp;-   each of which produces graduate level professionals.&nbsp; Physical and life   sciences include graduate school&nbsp;research projects in sub-specialties   like <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/science/genomics.htm">genomics</a>, <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/science/biotech.htm">biotechnology</a>, <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/science/neurobiology.htm">neurobiology</a>, and <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/science/physiology.htm">physiology</a>.&nbsp; These examples illustrate some of the financial support benefiting graduate students and research professionals:</p>
         <p>The Smithsonian Institute <a href="http://www.si.edu/ofi/fellowships#111" target="_blank">lists fellowships</a> focusing on specialties ranging from molecular evolution to Native   American Studies.&nbsp; The organization issues fellowships according to its   longstanding commitment to diversity and equal opportunity.&nbsp; Applicants   are evaluated based on academic standing, scholarly qualifications,   experience and on the suitability of the proposed graduate studies   project to the Smithsonian mission of increasing and spreading   knowledge.</p>
         <p><a href="http://www.gf.org/about-the-foundation/the-fellowship/" target="_blank">John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowships</a>&nbsp;aid   mid-career students who have illustrated proven academic success and   extraordinary creative abilities within the arts.&nbsp; The awards are   distributed after two annual open competitions are held to establish   candidate pools &ndash; applications are submitted directly to the   Foundation.&nbsp; 3000-4000 applicants compete annually for approximately 200   fellowships, which are disbursed under counsel of the Foundation&rsquo;s   prestigious panel of academic&nbsp;advisors.</p>
         <p><a href="http://www.wilsoncenter.org/fellowships-grants" target="_blank">Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars</a> hosts 160 annual student fellowships for research on international   issues and policies.&nbsp; The organization&rsquo;s International Fellowship   Program puts forth several 9-month residency awards for qualified   applicants.</p>
         <p><a href="http://www.ssrc.org/fellowships/" target="_blank">Social Science Research Council</a>&nbsp;conducts   open competitions for various fellowships pertaining to regional   research specialties. Next Generation Social Sciences in Africa and <a href="http://www.ssrc.org/fellowships/" target="_blank">Eurasia Program Fellowships </a>round   out a stable of aid that also includes funds reserved for graduate   studies in Japan and China.&nbsp; Memorial awards for graduate students   include merit-based career-specific scholarships for career students in <a href="http://www.ssrc.org/fellowships/abe-fellowship-for-journalists/" target="_blank">journalism</a> and other fields.</p>
         <h2>Scholarships for Women and Minority PhD Candidates</h2>
         <p>Efforts to encourage graduate studies among traditionally   under-represented populations leads to scholarships and fellowships   exclusively for <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/women.htm">women</a> and <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/other-minority-scholarships.htm">minorities</a>.   Use your gender, cultural ancestry and academic major to uncover all   the aid that is available to further your graduate school education.&nbsp;   These well-known organizations are good starting points for   special-interest student assistance:</p>
