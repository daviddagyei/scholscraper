      <h2>  Score Some Big Funding    </h2>
	  
      <p>Every year thousands of high school football players dream of scoring   a full ride scholarship to college. Football scholarships are some of   the most lucrative, and most coveted, financial aid opportunities   available. They are also extremely competitive, and only the most   exceptional players will have a chance at winning a full tuition   football scholarship. While the competition is fierce, winning a   football scholarship can do more than just pay for college. Football   scholarships carry a great deal of prestige. Regardless of whether or   not the student remains in the sporting arena, that prestige will follow   them well into their professional careers.</p>
      <p>The road to winning a football scholarship is long, complicated, and   begins early in a student&rsquo;s high school career. While most students   pursuing academic scholarships will begin to prepare applications in   their junior and senior years of high school, football players need to   begin thinking about scholarships from the moment they join the high   school team. College recruiters look at an athletes performance   throughout their high school stay, and will often begin singling out   exceptional players well before their senior year.</p>
      <p><img src="https://www.collegescholarships.org/images/football-scholarships.jpg" width="433" class="aligncenter" height="277" alt="football scholarships" /></p>
      <h2>Media Visibility</h2>
      <p>College football is one of the most closely followed sports in the   United States, and it generates billions of dollars in revenue for   colleges, promoters, corporations and television networks. It is a   highly competitive sport that attracts only the best, and college   recruiters are always on the look out for the next generation of   exceptional players. While it may be every high school football player&rsquo;s   dream to make it onto an NCAA team, only the very best will be chosen.   For the lucky few, it can mean the start of a bright career in   professional football, sports management, coaching or even sports   journalism.</p>
      <h2>The Role of College Recruiters</h2>
      <p>Unlike most academic scholarships, where applications are accepted   from all interested students, football scholarships rely on college   recruiters to actively search out the best candidates. High school   football players who want to win a scholarship need to work closely with   their coaches to not only improve their game, but to catch the   attention of college recruiters. This means hours of training,   soliciting the coaches and recruiting officers of college teams, and   preparing a highlight video that will demonstrate your considerable   skills at the game. In many cases students must be recommended by their   high school coaches, so it is important to let the coaching staff at   your high school know that you intend to try for a football scholarship.   Winning a college football scholarship isn&rsquo;t easy, and it requires   talent, tenacity and the will to succeed.</p>
      <h2>Elite Football: NCAA</h2>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/home/index.html" target="_blank">National Collegiate Athletic Association</a> (NCAA) was created more than a century ago as a way to protect   student-athletes, and to regulate all aspects of football at the college   level. The NCAA consists of three divisions that set the rules by which   colleges recruit players and dispense financial aid. Each division is   also responsible for regulating the amateur status of players and the   rights and responsibilities of coaching personnel, as well as scheduling   the practice and playing seasons. All NCAA colleges are bound by the   rules of the organization, and are subject to severe penalties for any   infringement of those rules.</p>
      <h2>NCAA Division I</h2>
      <p>There are 236 NCAA Division I colleges and universities in the United   States. These include some of the big name schools like Michigan State,   Baylor, UCLA and Florida State. The Division I football teams are the   cream of the crop, and only the most exceptional high school players   will have access to scholarship money from these school. The NCAA has   limited the number of full-ride, and partial tuition, scholarships that   Division I schools can offer. Division I colleges are limited to 85 full   tuition scholarships per year. Competition for these scholarships is   more than fierce, and only the very elite football players will be   tapped for recruitment.</p>
      <h2>NCAA Division II</h2>
      <p>NCAA Division II schools tend to be smaller public universities or   private colleges. These schools have more limited finances than their   Division I counterparts, which is reflected in the number of   scholarships they can offer. The NCAA limits each Division II school to   36 full, or partial, scholarships per year. With this limited   availability of scholarships, Division II schools must look for the best   all round players to recruit for their schools. While the Division I   schools can offer scholarships to premier quarterbacks, Division II   schools tend to look for multi-talented players who can bring a wide   range of skills to their teams. While the scholarship opportunities may   be more limited, they do provide increased opportunities for the more   multifaceted players.</p>
      <h2>Popular Division I and Division II Scholarships</h2>
      <p>The following <a href="http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/NCAA/Finances/Finances+Student+Athlete+Benefits" target="_blank">NCAA endorsed scholarships</a> are available at Division I and Division II colleges and universities.   These programs are extremely lucrative but, as we have seen, they are   also highly competitive.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <em><strong>Walter Byers Scholarship</strong></em> is a renewable one-year postgraduate scholarship. Annual awards are $24,000.</li>
        <li>The <em><strong>Jim McKay Scholarship</strong></em> is a $10,000 annual award named in honor of the famous broadcaster. This is a one time award, and is not renewable.</li>
        <li>The <em><strong>NCAA Postgraduate Scholarship</strong></em> is a one time award   of $7,500. The postgraduate scholarship is not specific to football, and   may be applied to any NCAA regulated sport. 174 scholarships are   awarded annually, divided equally between male and female student   athletes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In addition to these scholarships, each Division I and Division II   college or university will have their own programs which they make   available to high value players. While many of these will be full ride   scholarships, schools are beginning to see the value in offering a   greater number of partial scholarships as a way of making their   recruitment allowances stretch farther.</p>
      <h2>NCAA Division III</h2>
      <p>Division III colleges are typically much smaller institutions that   place a greater emphasis on academics than their Division I or II   counterparts. While Division III schools may very well have excellent   football programs, the NCAA restricts them from offering football   scholarships of any kind. That does not mean, however, that Division III   schools are not looking for exceptional players. But what they are   looking for are elite players with firm academic backgrounds. Division   III schools may be restricted from offering football scholarships, but   they can offer general scholarships and grants to academically   impressive students who have excelled at high school football as an   extracurricular activity. In this way they can build successful college   teams, while bring the best and the brightest to their campuses.   Students who wish to pursue football at the college level, and who have   strong academic backgrounds, may find that Division III colleges offer   the best of both worlds.</p>
      <h2>NAIA Football Scholarships</h2>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.nmnathletics.com/HomePage.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=27900&amp;KEY=&amp;DB_OEM_ID=27900&amp;DB_LANG=&amp;IN_SUBSCRIBER_CONTENT" target="_blank">National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics</a> (NAIA) offers student-athletes an alternative to the larger NCAA   schools. The NAIA is comprised of 257 member colleges and universities   across the country. While NAIA colleges may lack the high profile of   NCAA schools, they offer many scholarship opportunities for students   looking to use their athletic prowess as a stepping stone to a quality   education. For those students who are more interested in pursuing a   degree than breaking into the majors, NAIA schools offer a way to turn   their football skills into scholarship funding to help pay for college.</p>
      <p>Like the NCAA, the NAIA regulates all aspects of the athletic   programs at its member schools. This includes scholarship and grant   programs. NAIA colleges and universities are limited to offering the   equivalent of 24 full tuition football scholarship per school. Many   colleges choose to offer partial awards as a way to increase the number   of available scholarships at their school. For example, an NAIA college   may offer 2 full scholarships, 20 half scholarships and 48 quarter   scholarships. As long as the total does not exceed the equivalent of 24   full ride scholarships, the college is abiding by the NAIA rules. This   provides greater opportunities for talented high school football players   to turn their passion into money for college.</p>
      <h2>NJCCA Football Scholarships</h2>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.njcaa.org/" target="_blank">National Junior College Athletics Association</a> is comprised of 525 member colleges across the country, 67 of which   have competitive football programs. These two year community colleges   often offer an intermediary step for students who are not prepared, or   who can not afford, to head directly to a traditional four year   university. Many student-athletes neglect to consider the financial aid   opportunities that may be available at the junior college level. Many   junior colleges offer football scholarships for talented high school   graduates who are pursuing their education at the community college   level. As with the scholarship programs endorsed by the NAIA, these   programs offer valuable financial assistance to students who may be more   interested in pursuing a degree than in pursuing a professional career   in athletics.</p>
      <p>Scholarship programs at NJCAA member colleges are not as strictly   regulated as those at either NCAA or NAIA schools. Every participating   junior college will have their own programs, and interested students   should contact their school&rsquo;s athletic department and office of   financial aid for details on any football scholarships which may be   available.</p>
      <h2>Ivy League</h2>
      <p>Ivy League Schools have a long standing reputation, and internal   rivalry, when it comes to football. However, Ivy League Schools are   restricted by their own rules from offering athletic scholarships. These   schools are academically focused above all else, and while they may be   part of the NCAA Division I roster they only offer academic   scholarships. This is not to say that they do not wish to recruit   talented football players to their campuses, but those players must be   able to pass scrutiny in the classroom. Football is important to all Ivy   League Schools, but as far as financial aid is concerned it is   considered an extracurricular activity. Students hoping for a   scholarship to Yale, Princeton or Harvard will have to succeed on their   academic merits alone.</p>
      <p>College football remains one of America&rsquo;s favorite sports, and   commands the attention and loyalty of fans across the country. Students   who excel at the game may find that their talent on the field may well   translate to the funding they need to pay for college.</p>
