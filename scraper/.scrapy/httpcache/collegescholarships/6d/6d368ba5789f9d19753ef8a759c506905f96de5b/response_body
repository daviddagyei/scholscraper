      <h2> Challenges Faced by Adult Students     </h2>
	  
<p>Modern demographic shifts include&nbsp;changes in the way individuals earn   college degrees.&nbsp; The traditional scholastic progression has students   finishing high school around age 18, and then continuing directly   to&nbsp;advanced degree programs.&nbsp; Today, growing numbers of college students   are earning degrees later in life.&nbsp; Some are <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/returning-students.htm">returning to school </a>after&nbsp;absences,&nbsp;but a significant number of individuals are simply matriculating as adult students.</p>
<p>College students of all ages depend on valuable financial aid to   tackle tuition costs and other expenses associated with higher   education.&nbsp; Cobbling a funding package for college draws from widespread   resources including <a href="http://studentaid.ed.gov/eligibility" target="_blank">government-sponsored &nbsp;student assistance programs</a>, privately funded education initiatives, campus-specific aid and other financial aid efforts that target <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/student-specific.htm">specific student groups</a>. Adults&nbsp;returning to higher education&nbsp;face unique obstacles in the financial aid arena.&nbsp; For example:<img src="https://www.collegescholarships.org/images/adult-student-scholarships.jpg" width="283" class="alignright" height="424" alt="adult student scholarships" /></p>
<ul>
  <li>Most scholarship opportunities are&nbsp;specifically designated for graduating high school seniors.</li>
  <li>Awards intended for incoming college freshmen sometimes exclude   adults; even those who are transferring credits from community colleges.</li>
  <li>A large number of grants and scholarships require&nbsp;students to be   enrolled full-time in order to qualify.&nbsp; Because they are established in   the workforce, many adult students only attend classes on a part-time   basis.</li>
  <li>Many adult students work full-time, so their incomes disqualify them   from need-based scholarships.&nbsp; As a result, adult&nbsp;college students are   expected to rely heavily on student loans&nbsp;to pay for college tuition and   other expenses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite working within a financial aid system that favors traditional   students, adults who are returning to college or getting a late start   are not excluded from needed financial assistance.&nbsp; Stalwart federal   financial aid programs like <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/programs/fpg/eligibility.html" target="_blank">Pell Grant </a>and William Ford Federal Direct Loans are prime resources for adults in college, who qualify based on <a href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/" target="_blank">FAFSA</a> results.&nbsp; The Free Application for Federal Student Aid is a   comprehensive application that opens financial aid doors for students of   all ages.&nbsp; Grants and loans are offered to students based on income,   assets and the cost of attending school.</p>
<p>Most adult students apply for financial aid as &lsquo;independent filers&rsquo;;   meaning they are not claimed as dependants on their parents federal   income tax returns.&nbsp; Since independent students have lower Expected   Family Contributions (EFC), their access to financial aid&nbsp;is sometimes   greater than those students whose parental income is factored-in to the   financial aid equation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/states.htm">State-specific financial aid</a> provides supplemental funding for adult students who require additional   resources. Your campus financial aid office is well-versed about   student assistance that is available in your state.&nbsp; Seek general aid   from the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/" target="_blank">U.S. Department of Education</a> and state-sponsored programs first, then turn your attention to   financial aid opportunities that recognize your unique role as an adult   student of higher education.&nbsp;Employers, professional associations,   national organizations, advocacy groups and a range of private sector   forces work to underwrite education for adult college students.</p>
<h2>Scholarships from Employers</h2>
<p>Employers are active in educational philanthropy that supports adult   education, and&nbsp;scholarships and other benefits often extend to family   members of employees.&nbsp; Educating the future workforce is a mission   shared by many corporate benefactors, so&nbsp;any adult student&rsquo;s financial   aid search should include scholarships that are offered by his/her   employer.</p>
<p>Eligibility requirements vary across companies; sometimes requiring   participating students to enroll in specific programs to land   funding.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was once common for only large employers to support   post-secondary education, but this benefit is quickly gaining&nbsp;popularity   with smaller companies that are committed to educating workers.   Depending where you work, your college financial aid portfolio might   benefit from&nbsp;employer scholarships worth $100&nbsp;to $15,000.</p>
<p>States help companies bring funding to adult students through   public/private partnerships that support advanced education.&nbsp; The Oregon   Student Assistance Commission, for example, administers the <a href="http://oregonstudentaid.gov/donate-employer-sponsored-scholarship-program.aspx" target="_blank">Employer-Sponsored Scholarship Program</a>&nbsp;within   the state.&nbsp; Participating companies earn additional tax credits by   administering college scholarships for employees and qualified   dependants.&nbsp; IRS guidelines establish how funding is disbursed, but   colleges are able to target certain vocations by defining scholarship   parameters.</p>
<p>Universities like Penn State Erie, The&nbsp;Behrend College administer <a href="http://psbehrend.psu.edu/admissions-financial-aid/financial-aid/types-of-aid/scholarships-1/undergraduate-scholarships-1/employer-based-scholarships" target="_blank">private employer scholarships</a> that benefit employees and their family members.&nbsp; Companies like <a href="https://secure.bd.psu.edu/FRMAdmissions/FinAid/HMRML.htm" target="_blank">Hammermill Paper</a> fund scholarships for past and present employees, their spouses and   their descendants.&nbsp; Residents of Erie, PA are eligible for the   Hammermill Scholarship; provided they have&nbsp;histories of exceptional   academic achievement and demonstrable financial need.&nbsp; <a href="https://secure.bd.psu.edu/FRMAdmissions/FinAid/SNAP.htm" target="_blank">Clark Family Scvholarships</a> benefit Penn State Erie students who are employed or related to employees of Parker-Hannifan/Snap-Tite, Inc.</p>
<p>Individual employers of all sizes support education, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/fortune500.htm">Fortune 500 companies which make funding available</a> to university students.</p>
<h2>State and National Scholarships</h2>
<p>Unique national scholarship opportunities exist for&nbsp;certain adult   student groups.&nbsp; Minorities and women; particularly mothers, qualify for   distinct programs that promote student body diversity. State   educational boards are committed to adult education, so returning   students qualify for state-backed funding that increases access for   non-traditional college students.</p>
<p>Talbots, the clothing manufacturer, is committed to helping women who choose non-traditional educational paths.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.talbots.com/online/landing/landingPage.jsp;jsessionid=6330A54534BBAD12AAE400C24131B7B0?landingPage=scholarship&amp;_requestid=110790" target="_blank">Talbots Charitable Foundation</a>&nbsp;has   administered more than $1.5 million worth of financial assistance to   adult women returning to college.&nbsp; Annual awards number in the dozens,   and are valued between $1000 and $10,000 each.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aspsf.org/students_otscholarships.html" target="_blank">Arkansas Single Parent Scholarship Fund</a> aids returning students who are responsible for dependant children.&nbsp;   The group maintains a listing of available scholarships, which augments   individual efforts made by campus financial aid offices, to bring needed   aid to adult students.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.antshe.org/" target="_blank">Association for Non-Traditional Students in Higher Education</a> stands as a valuable resource for adult students.&nbsp; The organization   advocates for adult learning, and also puts-forth its own scholarships   for adult university students.</p>
<h2>Colleges and Universities Provide Financial Aid for Adult Students</h2>
<p>Although some school-sponsored scholarships are intended for younger   college students, there are programs on campus that specifically support   the efforts of returning and adult students.&nbsp; Your college or   university&rsquo;s financial aid office is a clearinghouse&nbsp;for information   related to specific programs in-place at your school.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.dcs.wisc.edu/services/finanserv/RAS_scholars.htm" target="_blank">University of Wisconsin offers scholarships</a> for non-traditional students worth as much as $5,000 each.&nbsp; The funds   are reserved for&nbsp; students ages 25-50 who are pursuing their first   undergraduate degrees.&nbsp; The scholarships are administered to two select   groups:&nbsp; <a href="http://continuingstudies.wisc.edu/advising/nontrad-scholars.htm#returning" target="_blank">Returning adult students</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://continuingstudies.wisc.edu/advising/nontrad-scholars.htm#single-parent" target="_blank">single parent students</a>.&nbsp;   The Adult Career and Special Student Services Office promotes the   programs, which contain multiple distinct awards.&nbsp; The Alma Baron Second   Chance for Women Scholarship, for example, benefits women who meet   these eligibility requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>45 years of age or older</li>
  <li>Admitted and in good-standing at UW</li>
  <li>U.S. citizen</li>
  <li>Demonstrable need</li>
  <li>History of academic success</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.depaul.edu/admission-and-aid/Pages/scholarships.aspx" target="_blank">Depaul University</a> administers a stable of financial aid that specifically addresses adult   students&rsquo; college funding needs.&nbsp; The school&rsquo;s unique Accelerated Adult   Degree Completion Program recognizes the&nbsp;role of adult students that   require&nbsp;fast tracks to higher education.&nbsp; Each student accepted into the   program automatically realizes an annual scholarship&nbsp;worth $12,000.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.uindy.edu/financial-aid-for-school-for-adult-learning" target="_blank">University of Indianapolis</a> caters to adult learners, with financial aid programs specifically   designed for returning students and working adults.&nbsp; Extended evening   hours and the School for Adult Learning (SAL) are valuable resources for   adult students, who usually qualify for campus assistance.</p>
<p>Financial resources for adult learners are widespread and encompass a   range of educational specialties, including those mentioned above.&nbsp;   Please consult your school&rsquo;s financial aid office for expanded   information about the adult assistance programs available at your   school.</p>
