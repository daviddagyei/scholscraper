      <h2> Look for Scholarship Programs to Finance College Expenses    </h2>
	  
<p>Paying for college places families in the financial hot-seat.&nbsp;   Tuition, books, residence hall room and board, enrollment fees and other   ancillary&nbsp;expenses associated with higher education add-up quickly at   universities, junior colleges and technical schools.&nbsp; A majority of the   student population turns to some form of financial aid to get the job   done.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/loans/federal.htm">Federal programs</a> and supplemental <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/grants/state.htm">state-sponsored assistance</a> provide primary funding resources for many cash-strapped college students, who secure <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/grants/federal.htm">government-backed grants</a> and loans.</p>
<p>The transition into post-secondary school is expensive and difficult   for many college-aged young adults, but some members of the study body   face additional hurdles on the road to career education.&nbsp; Students with   intellectual, physical and emotional disabilities are uniquely   challenged in the face of higher education, so some financial aid is   reserved specifically for students with medical conditions.</p>
<p>Health conditions impact students differently, depending on the   severity and nature of each medical affliction.&nbsp; Student assistance is   available for college students diagnosed with <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/diabetic-students.htm">diabetes</a>, epilepsy, <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/health/multiple-sclerosis.htm">multiple sclerosis</a>,   leukemia and many other conditions.&nbsp; Students with health conditions   find financial aid opportunities in the public and private sectors, and   are well-served by campus financial aid efforts that uncover funding for   targeted student groups.&nbsp; Consult your educational advisor and   financial aid office for information about relevant funding in-place to   support your education.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.collegescholarships.org/images/health-condition-scholarships.jpg" class="aligncenter" width="425" height="282" alt="health condition scholarships" /></p>
<h2>Students with Cancer and Other&nbsp;Diseases Receive Campus Funding</h2>
<p>Cancer touches a significant segment of the student population, so   some financial aid is set aside specifically for college students   impacted by the disease.&nbsp; Childhood cancer survivors carry emotional and   psychological scars related to facing&nbsp;major life-threatening diseases,   but their&nbsp;dreams and lifelong aspirations remain intact. Survivors and   students coping with cancer during college benefit from scholarships   funded by medical associations, colleges and universities and a host of   philanthropic organizations. These examples illustrate some of   the&nbsp;resources put-forth&nbsp;for&nbsp;college students affected by cancer:</p>
<p>Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Philadelphia support higher education for   cancer survivors.&nbsp; The hospital&rsquo;s Cancer Center -&nbsp;Cancer Survivorship   Program administers <a href="http://www.chop.edu/service/oncology/our-programs/cancer-survivorship-program/scholarships/" target="_blank">Scholarships for Pediatric Cancer Survivors</a>.   Some scholarships are disease-specific, helping survivor&rsquo;s who beat   particular forms of cancer.&nbsp; While others; including the Andre Sobel   Award, are open to applicants who experience any&nbsp;catastrophic illness   between the ages of 12 and 21.&nbsp; These recently offered scholarships   target a range of participants, including <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/health/leukemic-students.htm">leukemia patients</a> and applicants who have been impacted by brain tumors:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Terry Zahn Memorial Scholarship</li>
  <li>Cancer For College Scholarship</li>
  <li>Jay&rsquo;s World Childhood Cancer Foundation Scholarships</li>
</ul>
<p>Financial aid for families faced with catastrophic illness recognizes   the devastating financial impact that cancer treatment costs and other   medical bills have on college funds. American Cancer Society Youth   Scholarship Award Program provides financial aid for deserving cancer   survivors and patients facing college funding shortfalls.&nbsp; Awards are   issued directly to participating institutions to offset tuition and   other campus expenses at universities and technical colleges.&nbsp;   Assistance is disbursed by the organization&rsquo;s regional divisions, like a <a href="http://www.cancer.org/myacs/midwest/youthscholarship" target="_blank">Midwest Division Scholarship Award</a> aimed at resident students in Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota and Wisconsin.&nbsp; To qualify, each applicant meets these criteria:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Received cancer diagnoses prior to reaching age 21</li>
  <li>Under the age of 25 at the time of application</li>
  <li>Resident of Minnesota, Iowa, South Dakota or Wisconsin</li>
  <li>Accepted to attend accredited four or two-year university or vocational school</li>
  <li>Completed application process</li>
  <li>Submitted Expected Family Contribution information drawn from <a href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/" target="_blank">Free Application for Federal Student Assistance</a> (FAFSA)</li>
</ul>
<p>The review committee selects scholarship recipients based on performance metrics that include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Commitment to education and career-training</li>
  <li>Level of financial need &ndash; as determined by FAFSA application</li>
  <li>Leadership qualities</li>
  <li>Community participation</li>
</ul>
<p>Since mainstream scholarships typically require full-time,   uninterrupted college enrollment, students with medical limitations are   sometimes excluded from consideration.&nbsp; Supplemental funds for students   with health conditions enable them to pursue education at a pace that   reflects their abilities.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cancer.org/myacs/california/programsandservices/young-cancer-survivor-scholarship-program" target="_blank">California Young Cancer Survivor Scholarship Program</a> is another ACS initiative that benefits students attending west coast   schools.&nbsp; Qualified applicants are subject to these requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>California resident</li>
  <li>Cancer survivor &ndash; diagnosed before age 18</li>
  <li>Under age 24 when applying for scholarships</li>
  <li>Demonstrated financial hardship</li>
  <li>Enrolled at accredited university or technical college within the State of California</li>
</ul>
<p>Each award is valued at up to $7500 per academic year.</p>
<p>An organization called SuperSibs! makes sure families receive   spiritual, emotional, and practical help coping with childhood cancer.&nbsp;   In addition to efforts aimed at siblings in the throes of uncertainty,   the group also administers educational assistance used by survivors, to   pay for college.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.supersibs.org/what-we-do/scholarship/" target="_blank">SuperSibs Scholarships</a> are funded by private grants and donations from cancer advocacy groups.</p>
<h2>MS Scholarships</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://msassociation.org/" target="_blank">Multiple Sclerosis Association of America</a>&nbsp;(MSAA)   awards about six scholarships each year to applicants familiar with the   challenges of life&nbsp;with multiple sclerosis.&nbsp;Scholarship eligibility is   not reserved exclusively for MS patients, but funding targets those who   need it most.

<h2>Blood &amp; Immune Diseases</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.hemophilia.org/NHFWeb/MainPgs/MainNHF.aspx?menuid=53&amp;contentid=36" target="_blank">National Hemophilia Foundation</a> lists these scholarships for students diagnosed with bleeding disorders:</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Child Scholarships</strong> are worth $1000 each to qualified applicants attending U.S. universities and vocational schools.</p>
<p><strong>Victory for Women Academic Scholarships for Women with Bleeding Disorders</strong> are valued at $2500 each, and multiple awards are made annually.&nbsp;   Students who receive the scholarship may not reapply in the future.</p>
<p><a href="http://idahoblood.org/Scholarships.aspx" target="_blank">The Statton Family Scholarship</a> benefits students enrolled at Juniata College who have been diagnosed   with&nbsp;diseases of the blood and/or immune system.&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility is also   extended to applicants with family members who suffer from&nbsp;blood   disorders.&nbsp; The scholarship value is determined by remaining need after   other financial aid is applied to college costs.&nbsp; First time enrollees   and transfer students are eligible to apply.</p>
