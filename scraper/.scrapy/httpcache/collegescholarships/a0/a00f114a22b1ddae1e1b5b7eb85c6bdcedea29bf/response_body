<h2>Don&rsquo;t be a Beauty School Dropout: Find the Money You Need To Finish School</h2>
	  	  
<p>The cosmetology industry has grown in leaps and bounds over the last   few decades. The pampering that was once reserved for the elite, has   become commonplace for the every day man and woman. Consequently the   demand for cosmetologists has opened up career opportunities for men and   women across the country. From hair cuts to pedicures; facials to   manicures, graduates of cosmetology schools learn how to pamper their   clients and give them a sense of well-earned luxury.</p>
<p>A career in cosmetology is not for everyone. It requires drive,   determination and a great degree of self-motivation. But for those   students with the necessary passion, a career in cosmetology can offer   both professional and financial independence.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.collegescholarships.org/images/cosmetology-scholarships.jpg" class="aligncenter" width="418" height="287" alt="cosmetology scholarships" /></p>
<h2>Scholarship Programs</h2>
<p>At first glance, cosmetology students may think that there are few,   if any, scholarship programs devoted to helping them achieve their   educational and professional goals. Liberal arts scholarships, and   scholarships for students pursuing degrees in science and mathematics   continue to get the lion&rsquo;s share of attention. But recently, there has   been a nationwide drive to promote vocational programs that prepare   students to enter the workforce with the marketable skills they will   need to succeed in their chosen careers. This has led to many   scholarship programs exclusively devoted to the financial demands of   cosmetology students. Whether you are training at a community college,   beauty school or vocational school, there may be a scholarship to fit   your needs.</p>
<p>Cosmetology scholarships are available from a number of different   sources, including businesses, corporations and professional   associations. Many scholarships are supported directly through beauty   schools, colleges and vocational schools. For students moving into the   heady world of cosmetology, the opportunities for financial aid have   rarely looked better.</p>
<h2>Scholarships Sponsored by the Beauty Industry</h2>
<p>Many businesses and corporations associated with the beauty industry   provide scholarship opportunities to cosmetology students struggling to   meet their tuition costs. These scholarships may be based on merit or   need, and may include restrictions concerning the student&rsquo;s school of   attendance. As with all scholarship programs, the first key to receiving   any award is to apply early. These are career specific scholarships,   and as such there will be a limited number of awards and large number of   applicants.</p>
<p>The following is a sampling of cosmetology scholarships supported by   corporations and businesses closely linked to the beauty and lifestyle   industry.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.greatclips.com/stylists/scholarship-program" target="_blank">Alice Madden Barton Scholarship Program</a> is sponsored Great Clips, the national salon chain. Scholarship awards   are available to all high school graduates who are interested in   pursuing cosmetology or barbering as a career. Awards are given twice   annually, in January and and July.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://joefrancis.com/" target="_blank">Joe Francis Haircare Scholarship Foundation</a> was founded by one of the premier entrepreneurs in the haircare   industry. The foundation provides $1000 scholarships to eligible   students applying to, or enrolled in, a barbering or cosmetology school.   More than 20 scholarships are awarded annually.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.sallybeauty.com/scholarship/PAGE_SCHOLARSHIP,default,pg.html" target="_blank">PBA/NCA Sally Beauty Scholarship</a> is sponsored by the Sally Beauty Store chain. Seven $1000 scholarships   are awarded annually to high school graduates pursuing a career in   cosmetology. A further six $500 scholarships are available to industry   professionals who are returning to school for further training.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Scholarships Sponsored by Professional Associations</h2>
<p>Professional associations and organizations often provide valuable   scholarship opportunities for students pursuing careers in the   industries they serve. Students interested in pursuing cosmetology as a   career will want to look into the financial aid programs supported and   promoted by professional associations that advocate for the beauty   industry.</p>
<p>The following selection of scholarships are supported in whole, or in   part, by professional associations connected with the cosmetology   industry.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.beautyschools.org/careers-in-beauty/grants_scholarships/" target="_blank">Beauty Changes Lives Scholarship</a> is sponsored in collaboration with the <strong><em>American Association of Cosmetology Schools</em></strong>.   $2000 scholarships are available to students enrolled in esthetics,   nails, barbering or massage at a participating school of cosmetology.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.ncea.tv/scholarships-grants" target="_blank">NCEA Esthetician Scholarship</a> is supported by the <strong><em>National Coalition of Estheticians, Manufacturers/Distributors and Associations</em></strong>.   The $1000 scholarship is offered to students who can demonstrate the   required level of academic achievement and financial need.

  <li>The <a href="http://www.ahbai.org/scholar/cosmetology.html" target="_blank">Fred Luster Sr. Education Foundation Scholarship</a> is sponsored by the <a href="http://www.ahbai.org/index.html" target="_blank">American Health and Beauty Aids Institute</a>.   The foundation offers 12 annual $250 scholarships for students pursuing   cosmetology training.

  <li>The <a href="http://www.probeauty.org/scholarships/#minerva" target="_blank">Professional Beauty Association/National Cosmetology Association</a> sponsors a variety of scholarships for cosmetology students, including the<a href="http://www.probeauty.org/docs/minerva_application.pdf" target="_blank"> Minerva Beauty Scholarship</a> and the <a href="http://www.probeauty.org/docs/smoothshine_application.pdf" target="_blank">Smooth and Shine Cosmetology Scholarship</a>.   To be eligible students must be enrolled in an accredited cosmetology   program, must have a minimum 3.0 GPA, and must present a letter of   recommendation from an industry professional. Fifteen $1000 scholarships   are awarded annually.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Scholarships From Colleges and Beauty Schools</h2>
<p>Community colleges, vocational schools and cosmetology schools often   sponsor, or administer scholarship programs for deserving students. Some   of these programs are supported directly by the school, while others   are supported by state funds and private endowments. Students interested   in pursuing a career in cosmetology should contact their school&rsquo;s   office of financial aid for information on scholarship programs which   may be available to them.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.empire.edu/" target="_blank">Empire Beauty Schools</a> administer a wide variety of scholarships and grants for students   enrolled, or preparing to enroll, in one of their many cosmetology   programs. Chief among the many financial aid programs available to   students attending an Empire Beauty School is the <a href="http://www.empire.edu/pdf/Empires-National-Educator-Scholarship-Application.pdf" target="_blank">Empire National Educator Scholarship</a>. The award amount varies, but may cover up to the total cost of tuition</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.highland.cc.il.us/admissions/schol_details.asp?SID=4" target="_blank">Virginia Ames Cosmetology Scholarship</a> is available to students attending<a href="http://www.highland.cc.il.us/index.asp" target="_blank"> Highland Community College</a> in Northwestern Illinois. To be eligible, applicants must be full time   students in the HCC Cosmetology program. Award amounts vary, and are   determined by academic achievement and financial need.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.isu.edu/scholar/list_technology.shtml" target="_blank">Robert and Irene Kimber Cosmetology Scholarship</a> is available to students enrolled in the cosmetology program at <a href="http://www.isu.edu/" target="_blank">Idaho State University</a>.   To be eligible students must have a minimum 2.0 GPA, and must   demonstrate the requisite level of financial need. Award amounts vary.</li>
  <li><a href="http://aveda.edu/" target="_blank">Aveda Institutes</a> own   and operate beauty schools in nearly every state in the country. One of   North America&rsquo;s most respected Cosmetology Schools, Aveda Institutes   offer a wide range of financial aid programs, including scholarships,   for their enrolled students. Each school supports its own selection of   programs, and students are encouraged to contact their closest Aveda   Institute for information on scholarship programs currently being   sponsored.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.austin.edu/" target="_blank">Austin&rsquo;s School of Spa Technology</a> in Albany, New York offers a number of financial aid programs, including the <a href="http://www.austin.edu/student-services/financial-aid" target="_blank">Austin&rsquo;s School of Spa Technology Alumni Scholarship</a>. The program awards ten $300 scholarships per year. To be eligible students must be nominated by an alumni of the school.</li>
</ul>
<p>The sampling of scholarship opportunities discussed here are just the   beginning of the financial aid opportunities open to students pursuing a   professional career in the beauty industry.</p>
<p>A career in cosmetology offers a bright and exciting future. Licensed   cosmetologists often start their own small businesses, opening spas and   salons as their careers advance. Some ultimately find themselves   working in the television and film industry. If the abundance of   scholarships is any indication, lucrative careers in cosmetology are   here to stay.</p>
