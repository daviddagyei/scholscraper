      <h2> Get Paid to Learn the Trade     </h2>
	  
<p>Like&nbsp;other educational pursuits, getting certified in the&nbsp;automotive   trades creates&nbsp;significant financial&nbsp;hurdles for students.&nbsp;&nbsp;Specialized   education does not come cheap, but there is financial help available in   the form of grants, loans and scholarships.&nbsp; And the&nbsp;industry serves   more than just automobile mechanics.&nbsp; Technical schools and automotive   educators train a cadre of forward-thinking students, who land   employment in specialized car-related fields like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Auto Body and Paint</li>
  <li>Upholstery</li>
  <li>Collision Repair and Refinishing</li>
  <li>Automotive Technology</li>
  <li>Diesel and Truck Technology</li>
  <li>Motorcycle Technology</li>
  <li>Master Certified Automotive Technology</li>
  <li>NASCAR and Pit Crews</li>
</ul>
<p>Students who enroll in these programs need help funding their   certificate, associate&rsquo;s and bachelor&rsquo;s degree pursuits. A&nbsp;variety of   interested entities&nbsp;bring automotive schooling into reach by extending   financial aid to a wide cross-section of&nbsp;students.&nbsp;Student aid   originates from diverse sources, including industry associations,   foundations, educators, and private sector players.&nbsp; General financial   aid from the U.S Federal Government and individual state education   departments can be applied to tuition costs and other automotive   training expenses at accredited schools.&nbsp; Refine your personal auto   industry employment dream, and then target student&nbsp;aid designed to lift   you into the proper educational programs.</p>
<h2>Automotive Industry Associations<img src="https://www.collegescholarships.org/images/auto-mechanic-scholarships.jpg" width="283" height="424" alt="auto student scholarships" class="alignright" /></h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.automotivehalloffame.org/education" target="_blank">Automotive Hall of Fame</a> in Dearborn, Michigan serves as administrator for a number of annual   automotive scholarships.&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility requires interest and aptitude in   qualified automotive disciplines.&nbsp; Financially needy students are given   special consideration when they are enrolled full-time at&nbsp;accredited   universities or colleges.&nbsp; Scholarships are put-forth for incoming   freshman and upper-level undergraduate students, but all candidates must   maintain the 3.0 GPA standard to qualify for the funds.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.automotivehalloffame.org/resources/pdf/file-20120525120332.pdf" target="_blank">application process</a>&nbsp;requires students to submit the following materials:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Academic transcripts</li>
  <li>Two letters of recommendation specifically supporting automotive aptitude</li>
  <li>Letter of acceptance to&nbsp; associate&rsquo;s, bachelor&rsquo;s or master&rsquo;s program</li>
  <li>Proof of enrollment at accredited school</li>
  <li>U.S. citizenship</li>
  <li>Completed scholarship request</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.autoserviceproviders.com/" target="_blank">Alliance of Automotive Service Providers</a>&nbsp;is   a national industry association with local affiliates.&nbsp; The   organization&rsquo;s educational efforts include scholarships and grants that   are issued by state chapters.&nbsp; In Minnesota, automotive career students   received $16,000 during the 2012-2013 school year.&nbsp; Each award, worth   $1000, helped offset tuition expenses for a 2nd year automotive   student.&nbsp; Funding for the scholarships is generated through fundraising   efforts and public/private partnerships.</p>
<h2>Work-Related Options</h2>
<p>Car-related companies are generous student aid   benefactors.&nbsp;&nbsp;Automotive retailers&nbsp;pay&nbsp;scholarship dividends to aspiring   industry professionals. While they&nbsp;are not necessarily automotive   study-specific, they provide&nbsp;great sources of funding for&nbsp;trade students   pursuing industry degrees.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.carquest.com/" target="_blank">CARQUEST</a> awards four annual scholarships worth $1,000 each to technicians and   their family members.&nbsp; Additionally, employees of the company   are&nbsp;eligible for&nbsp;education scholarships that can be applied to full-time   tuition in automotive courses of study and other degree programs.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.autozoneinc.com/about_us/community_relations/autozone_scholarships.html" target="_blank">AutoZone</a> awards scholarships valued at $2,500 each&nbsp;to fifteen students every   year. Qualified applicants are graduating high school seniors that are   employed by AutoZone, or&nbsp;are dependents of someone who has worked for   the company for at least one year. Community service, scholastic   achievement, extracurricular school activities and leadership qualities   are among the criteria&nbsp;used to determine winners.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Foundations</h2>
<p>Universal Technical Institutes&nbsp;supports and encourages technical education through its <a href="http://www.utifoundation.net/uti-foundation/scholarships-grants" target="_blank">UTI Foundation</a>.&nbsp;   Students enrolled in auto industry disciplines like automotive repair,   collision repair, motorcycle mechanics, marine repair and NASCAR   programs benefit from scholarships, grants and career development   initiatives put forth by the foundation.&nbsp; These UTI student aid   resources address a variety of schooling expenses:</p>

<p><a href="http://cdn.uti.edu/foundationpdf/Burke_InfoAppl.pdf" target="_blank">William Burke Student Support Fund</a> issues a single scholarship each year, to a student enrolled&nbsp;in the   Motorcycle Mechanics Institute&rsquo;s Early Model Program.&nbsp; The specialized   award applies to the Orlando, FL campus, and is worth $1,100 annually.<img src="https://www.collegescholarships.org/images/single-mom-college-grants.jpg" width="283" height="424" alt="auto student scholarships" class="alignleft" /></p>
<p>A Partnership between UTI and Toyota Motor Sales matches scholarship dollars provided by the Cabito family.&nbsp; The <a href="http://cdn.uti.edu/Foundationpdf/Cabito_Info_App.pdf" target="_blank">Albert Cabito</a> fund provides one $2000 scholarship each quarter to students enrolled at UTI or NTI automotive campuses.</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn.uti.edu/foundation/Scholarships/CFCMilitaryVeteransSupportGrant_InfoAppl.pdf" target="_blank">Military Veterans Support Grants</a> worth up to $750 are disbursed to veterans who are under financial   duress sufficient to slow their access to automotive education.&nbsp; Funds   can be used for school costs, relocation, and other education related   expenses like rent and utilities.</p>
<p>Nissan North America, Nissan Neighbors and the UTI Foundation partner   with Nissan and Infiniti dealers to fund scholarships for students   interested in completing the <a href="http://cdn.uti.edu/foundation/Scholarships/NissanInfoAppl.pdf" target="_blank">Nissan Automotive Technical Training Program</a>.&nbsp;   The full-tuition scholarships are worth $5000 each, and can be applied   to program requirements at NASCAR Tech, Houston, Orlando and Sacramento   UTI campuses.</p>
