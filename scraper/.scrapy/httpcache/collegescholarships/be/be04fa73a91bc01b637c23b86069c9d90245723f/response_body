	      <h2>Diverse Student Spectrum </h2>
	      <p>The national student body is as diverse as the population of the   country itself. The abundance of financial aid programs reflects this   great level of diversity by offering scholarships for students from many   different backgrounds, and with many diverse interests. While we are   all familiar with high profile academic and athletic scholarships, there   are many more programs designed to reward a deserving student&rsquo;s   extracurricular activities, personal hobbies and interests, unique   talents and distinctive cultural heritage.</p>
          <p>Most college-bound students are generally aware of the scholarship   programs supported by government agencies, universities and   corporations. These high profile financial aid programs get the lion&rsquo;s   share of the attention, but there are many more scholarship programs   available to the industrious student who is prepared to do some   research, and spend some time hunting them down. These programs may be   supported by local or national civic groups, clubs and associations,   businesses or independent endowments.</p>
          <p><img src="https://www.collegescholarships.org/images/student-specific-scholarships.jpg" width="425" height="282" class="aligncenter" alt="Student specific scholarships" /></p>
          <h2>Scholarships that Support Student Activities</h2>
          <p>Extracurricular activities are often a consideration in many   merit-based scholarship programs. The student&rsquo;s participation in various   clubs and civic groups can be a deciding factor in the awards process.   But there are also a number of scholarships solely devoted to rewarding a   student&rsquo;s interests, hobbies and club affiliations. When searching for   college funding, look for scholarship programs that are closely linked   to your own hobbies and interests. Also consider funding that may be   available from any regional or national clubs to which you belong, and   contact the administrative offices of the organization to find out if   they support any college scholarships for their active members.</p>
          <p>Please refer to the following sections for more information on scholarships dedicated to extracurricular activities.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/scouts.htm">Scholarships for members of the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts of America</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/politics.htm">Scholarships for Students Active in Politics</a></li>

          </ul>
          <h2>Students in Non-Traditional Schools</h2>
          <p>Colleges and universities routinely offer scholarships to attract the   best and brightest students to their campuses. But not all students   take the road well traveled in their pursuit of an education. Many   students choose a different course, and may have very different   educational goals and backgrounds.</p>
          <p>For example, the trend for home schooling is growing across the   country. Many parents are now choosing to remove their children from the   public school system, and educate them at home. While this can offer   children an intense, and highly structured, learning environment, it   also isolates them from the standard pool of scholarships and grants   available to public high school graduates. Recently, a number of   organizations have developed scholarship programs specifically dedicated   to home schooled students. The following section contains specific   information on financial aid programs dedicated to home schooled   students.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/homeschool.htm">Scholarships for Home Schooled Students</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Just as students may have different educational backgrounds, they may   well&nbsp; have different educational goals. Traditional 2-year and 4-year   colleges may not suit everyone&rsquo;s career goals, and many students choose   to enroll in vocational schools and technical colleg s as a way to   obtain the education they need to move quickly, and successfully, into   the national workforce. Students choosing this educational path also   require financial aid, and many scholarship programs have been developed   to help them reach their goals. Here at College Scholarships we have   two sections with information designed to help these students find the   financial aid they need. Interested students should refer to the   following pages:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/vocational-school.htm">Scholarships for Vocational Schools</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/technical-school.htm">Scholarships for Technical Colleges</a></li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Women, Minority, and Multi-Ethnic Students</h2>
          <p>As students search for financial aid for college, they will find a   large number of grants and scholarships designed to benefit both gender   and ethnic minorities. These programs are fairly well established, and   generally apply to every field of study. African-American&rsquo;s, Native   Americans, Asian-Americans and Hispanics will be able to find a wide   range of scholarship programs dedicated to helping them achieve their   educational goals. Many of these programs concentrate on students   pursuing distinct career paths, and offer incentives for minority   students to pursue an education in fields in which they have been   historically under-represented. The majority of minority specific   scholarships are dedicated to teaching, healthcare, science, technology,   engineering and mathematics.</p>
          <p>For more detailed information on minority scholarships please refer to the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/women.htm">Scholarships for Women</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/other-minority-scholarships.htm">College Scholarships for Minorities</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/interracial.htm">Interracial and Multicultural Scholarships</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Many students who do not fit within the commonly perceived ethnic   minority category, may find that their own cultural heritage also offers   an avenue to college funding. Many regional and national civic groups   provide scholarships for members of their own cultural community. For   example , the <a href="http://www.niaf.org/scholarships/" target="_blank">National Italian-American Foundation</a> provides scholarships for students of Italian descent. Many other national organizations, such as the <a href="http://www.ugac.org/resources/res_student.html" target="_blank">German-American Heritage Foundation</a>, and the <a href="http://www.jacl.org/edu/scholar.htm" target="_blank">Japanese-American Citizens League</a> also support scholarship programs for students according to their   cultural heritage. Students looking for college funding should consider   their own family&rsquo;s cultural heritage as a link to further financial aid.</p>
          <h2>Religious or Theological Studies</h2>
          <p>Many faith-based scholarships are available to students from within   their own religious communities. These programs may be supported at the   local or national levels, and typically offer financial support to   students who have demonstrated a strong commitment to their church and   their faith. Some of these scholarship programs may offer financial aid   to students pursuing general studies, while others may specifically   target those students who are pursuing religious and theological   studies. College-bound students of every faith &ndash; Jewish, Muslim,   Buddhist, Hindu and Christian &ndash; should contact their religious leaders   for information on scholarship and grant programs designed to help them   realize their educational goals.</p>
          <p>For further information on faith-based scholarships please refer to our section on <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/religion.htm">Religious and Theological Scholarships</a>.</p>
          <h2>Disabilities</h2>
          <p>Students with disabilities face a number of challenges, not the least   of which is finding the necessary funds to pay for college. Many   national organizations support scholarships for students with physical   disabilities, learning disabilities and debilitating health conditions.   Students with disabilities, or severe health issues, should begin their   financial aid search by concentrating on regional and national   organizations devoted to their specific condition. It can also be   beneficial to link the specific disability or health condition with the   student&rsquo;s desired area of study.</p>
          <p>For more specific information on scholarship programs devoted to   helping students with disabilities please refer to the following   sections of the College Scholarships website.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/disabilities.htm">Scholarships for Students with Physical and Learning Disabilities</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/medical-conditions.htm">Scholarships for Students with Severe or Debilitating Health Conditions</a></li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Hardship and Circumstance Scholarships</h2>
          <p>A large number of scholarship and grant programs target those   students in extreme, or unique, personal circumstances. Often, these   programs will be regionally based, and will target the dependents of   first responders, military personnel or disaster survivors. Still other   programs are designed to help students from &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; and &ldquo;low income&rdquo;   communities, and children aging out of the foster care system. The one   thing all of these scholarship programs have in common, is that they are   decided according to the applicant&rsquo;s unique life circumstances. The   search for these scholarship programs should begin at the local level,   with students contacting their state&rsquo;s Department of Higher Education.   Following that, the search can broaden to include national programs that   may address the individual student&rsquo;s needs.</p>
          <p>The following sections contain more information on scholarships and   grants designed to benefit students with unique life circumstances:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/september-11th.htm">Scholarships for the Dependents and Survivors of the September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attacks</a></li>

            <li><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/risk.htm">Scholarships for At-Risk Students</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/first-in-family.htm">First In Family Scholarships</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/firemen.htm">Scholarships for Firefighters and their Dependents</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/military-students.htm">Scholarships for Military Personnel and their Dependents</a></li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Exciting Scholarship Opportunities for Non-Traditional Students</h2>
          <p>Non-traditional students face a number of different obstacles in   their quest for a college education. Non-traditional students are   typically adults who are returning to school to complete an interrupted   education, or are heading to college for job training to make them more   successful in the workforce. Military personnel, both active and   retired, also fall into this category. In many cases, these   non-traditional students must juggle a return to school with work and   family responsibilities, making their college career even more   challenging.</p>
          <p>While most scholarship programs target what is considered the average   college bound student, young and fresh out of high school, many new   programs are being developed to help older students who don&rsquo;t fit the   established mold. As more and more adults return to college, financial   aid programs specifically designed to address their needs as students   are becoming available.</p>
          <p>For details on scholarships and grants designed to support the   non-traditional student, please refer to the following sections of the   College Scholarship website:</p>
      <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/non-traditional.htm">Scholarships for Non-Traditional Students</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/returning-students.htm">Scholarships for Returning Students</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/military-students.htm">Scholarships for Military Service</a></li>
          </ul>
      <p>Scholarships come from a wide range of sources, and address the needs   of a wide range of students. The uniqueness of a student&rsquo;s background,   cultural heritage and life experience can lead to a wide array of   scholarship opportunities. The secret is to apply your own individuality   to your search for college funding. Leave no stone unturned, and don&rsquo;t   quit until you have exhausted all of the financial aid possibilities.</p>
