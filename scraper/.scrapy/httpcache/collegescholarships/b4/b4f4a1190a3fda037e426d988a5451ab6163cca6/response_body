      <h2>  Scholarship Funding for Social Workers    </h2>
	  
<p>A career in social work is a noble calling that requires a unique   dedication to the welfare of others. Social workers provide a vital   service to the communities in which they serve, and it is often only   through their dedication that the disadvantaged are able to find the   help and support they need in times of crisis. A career in social work   can take many paths, and students may find themselves working with   children and families, abuse survivors, or the mentally and physically   disabled. Social workers may find themselves employed by the state, in   schools or in public healthcare facilities.</p>
<p>Social work offers a wide range of professional possibilities, but it   also requires an extensive education. While there are some professional   positions open to graduates with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree, most social work   requires a masters or doctorate degree. For students interested in   pursuing a career in social work that means further schooling, and a   greater financial burden. But there are many scholarship opportunities   dedicated to helping students achieve their professional ambitions, and   pursue degrees and careers in social work. These scholarship programs   may be supported by government funding, private endowments, professional   associations, or colleges and universities.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.collegescholarships.org/images/social-worker-scholarships.jpg" class="aligncenter" width="425" height="282" alt="social worker scholarships" /></p>
<h2>Field-Specific Scholarships for Social Workers</h2>
<p>The general field of social work encompasses a number of   sub-disciplines, and most scholarship programs for social workers are   dedicated to specific areas of service. Students should begin their   search for scholarships by concentrating on the fields in which they are   most interested. For example, a student who wishes to work with   survivors of sexual abuse would want to search for scholarship programs   dedicated to that field 0f social work. By focusing on their ultimate   career goals, students will be able to find scholarships specifically   tailored to their field of study.</p>
<p>The following examples of field-specific scholarships will give   students an idea of what can be found when they search for programs   devoted to their chosen areas of interest.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.legacyforhealth.org/adams-scholarship.aspx" target="_blank">Dr. Alma S. Adams Scholarship</a> is sponsored by the American Legacy Foundation. Two $5000 scholarships   are awarded annually to undergraduate and graduate students pursuing   degrees in social work, with an emphasis on the reduction of tobacco use   in priority populations. Awards are determined by community service in   an under-served community, and the best use of art and media in raising   awareness concerning the harmful effects of tobacco.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.naswfoundation.org/gosnell.asp" target="_blank">Consuelo W. Gosnell Memorial Scholarship</a> is administered by the <a href="http://www.naswfoundation.org/default.asp" target="_blank">National Association of Social Workers</a>.   A $2000 scholarship will be awarded to students who demonstrate a   commitment to working within the Native-American, Native Alaskan, and   Hispanic-American communities. Eligible students must be members of the   NASW, and must be enrolled in an accredited Masters in Social Work   program.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.naswfoundation.org/lyons.asp" target="_blank">Verne LaMarr Lyons Memorial Scholarship</a>, also administered by the <a href="http://www.naswfoundation.org/default.asp" target="_blank">National Association of Social Workers</a>,   is available to students pursuing their Masters Degree in Social Work.   Students must demonstrate a commitment to serving the mental and   physical health needs of the African-American community. Eligible   students must be members of the NASW, must be enrolled in an accredited   Masters of Social Work program and must have a minimum 3.0 GPA.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.nysarc.org/supports-and-services/scholarships-and-awards/scholarships/" target="_blank">James F. Reville Scholarship</a> is a $3000 award given to full-time students enrolled in studies   related to intellectual and developmental disabilities at an accredited   New York State college or university. Award determinations are made   according to academic merit, and students must be nominated by a faculty   member from their college of attendance.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.ashaweb.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageID=3324&amp;themonth=07&amp;theyear=2012" target="_blank">American School Health Association Scholarship</a> provides financial assistance to students pursuing a degree in social   work with an emphasis on the health needs of children Three $1000   scholarships are awarded annually in the fields of pediatric and   adolescent medicine or dentistry, school health education and school   nursing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>National Associations and Social Worker Scholarships</h2>
<p>As students progress through their search for applicable   scholarships, special attention should be given to those associations   and organizations that represent social workers, or that are directly   linked to specific social services. Beyond general associations of, and   for, social workers, look to organizations and advocacy groups that   represent the needs of those sectors of the population that most benefit   from social workers and social services. These may be advocacy groups   for the elderly, the disabled, or the disadvantaged, or they may be   support groups for victims of abuse and sexual assault.</p>
<p>The following examples will give students a better idea of what types   of organizations they are looking for, and the scholarships they   support.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.cswe.org/CentersInitiatives/ScholarshipsandFellowships.aspx" target="_blank">Council on Social Work Education</a> supports a variety of scholarships and fellowships, including the <strong><em>CSWE Scholars Program</em></strong>, The <strong><em>Carl A. Scott Memorial Fund</em></strong>and the <strong><em>CSWE Minority Fellowship Program</em></strong>.   All of the CSWE&rsquo;s programs offer varying levels of financial support   for undergraduate and graduate level students pursuing a career in   social work.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.nysarc.org/supports-and-services/scholarships-and-awards/scholarships/" target="_blank">New York State Association for Retarded Children</a> (NYSARC) is a regionally based advocacy group working to better the   lives of children and adults with learning disabilities. The NYSARC   supports a number of scholarships, including the <strong><em>Arthur W. Pense Scholarship</em></strong>, the <strong><em>Joseph T. Weingold Scholarship</em></strong> and the <strong><em>Jonathon Weingold Scholarship</em></strong>.   Each of the scholarships awards $3000 to eligible students pursuing   their degrees in social work with an emphasis on intellectual and   developmental disabilities.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.socialworkers.org/" target="_blank">National Association of Social Workers</a> is a national advocacy group with regional chapters across the country.   The NASW provides support and information for professionals in all   fields of social work. Student members have access to a variety of   scholarship and fellowship programs through the <a href="http://www.naswfoundation.org/" target="_blank">National Association of Social Workers&rsquo; Foundation</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Social Work and Religious Affiliations</h2>
<p>Many religious organizations set aside funds to support students who   are pursuing careers in community service and social work. These   programs are typically restricted to members of the faith in general,   and often to members of specific congregations. Students interested in   pursuing social work as a career, should contact the leaders of their   church, synagogue or other religious community for information on   financial aid which may be available to help them pay for college.</p>
<p>These few examples will give an idea of the types of aid that may be available from within your religious community.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://bethesdalutherancommunities.org/page.aspx?pid=707" target="_blank">Lutheran Student Scholastic and Service Scholarship</a> is sponsored by Bethesda Lutheran Communities. The scholarship is   available to students who are active, communicant members of a Lutheran   Congregation.

The scholarship is open to freshmen, sophomores and   juniors with a minimum 3.0 GPA who are enrolled at an accredited college   or university. Award amounts range from $3000 to $10,000.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.jccworks.com/index.htm?p=C91E7" target="_blank">Jewish Community Centers of North America Graduate Scholarship</a> provides merit-based financial aid to Jewish students who are pursuing   degrees in a number of fields, including social work, health services   and childhood education. Eligible students may receive up to $10,000 per   year, for two years, while they pursue their graduate degree.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.presbyterianmission.org/ministries/financialaid/student-opportunity-scholarship/" target="_blank">Presbyterian Church(USA) Student Opportunity Scholarship</a> provides need-based financial aid for sophomores, juniors and seniors   who are full-time, first degree seeking students.

Scholarships are   available to students pursuing degrees in a variety of fields, including   health services, social work and education.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Social Work Scholarships Through Your College</h2>
<p>Students pursuing a degree in social work will also want to consult   with their college&rsquo;s office of financial aid to learn of any programs   specific to their school. Many colleges and universities support   scholarships and fellowships for both undergraduate and graduate level   students pursuing a degree in social work. Programs and requirements   will vary widely from school to school.</p>
<p>The following examples will give students an idea of what may be available at their college or university.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.bc.edu/" target="_blank">Boston College</a> administers a wide variety of scholarships and fellowships for its students, including the <a href="http://www.bc.edu/research/osp/funding/external/gradfellowship.html" target="_blank">AARP- Andrus Foundation&rsquo;s Graduate Scholarships and Fellowships in Gerontology</a>.   This program offers financial assistance to graduate students pursuing   their studies in gerontology, with an emphasis on aging-related social   work. Award amounts range from $7000 to $15,000.</li>

Awards vary according to   available funding, course of study and academic achievement.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.ysu.edu/" target="_blank">Youngstown State University</a> offers a wide variety of financial aid through its <a href="http://web.ysu.edu/gen/bcohhs/Scholarships_m80.html" target="_blank">Bitonte College of Health and Human Services </a>.

Current programs include the<strong><em> Barbara Lewis Roberts Memorial Scholarship</em></strong>, the <strong><em>Doris Burdman Scholarship</em></strong>, the <strong><em>Kimberly Ann DeOnofrio Memorial Scholarship</em></strong> and the <strong><em>Rubini Michelakis Meshel Scholarship</em></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>State-Based Scholarships for Social Workers</h2>
<p>Many states around the country are currently experiencing a shortage   of qualified professionals in number of key professions vital to the   welfare of the state and its interior communities. These include   educators, nurses, primary healthcare providers and social workers. In   an effort to address these critical shortages, many states have   developed financial aid programs designed to encourage and support   students who are pursuing careers in these critical-need professions.   Students interested in pursuing a career as a social worker should   contact their state&rsquo;s Department of Higher Education for details on   scholarships, grants and loan-forgiveness programs that may help them   pay for college.</p>
<p>Social work is a noble career that requires a dedication to the   service of others. Properly educated social workers improve the lives of   millions of people in communities all across the country. It is a   challenging field to enter, but one that offers rewards few other   careers can match.</p>
