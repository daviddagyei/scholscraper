      <h2> Win Special Funding Awards     </h2>
	  
<p>Diabetics face unique challenges, but paying for college is a common   hurdle they encounter alongside&nbsp;other post-secondary students.&nbsp; Tuition,   books, room and board and associated fees add up quickly, so most   university students rely on some form of financial aid to meet   expenses.&nbsp; In fact, modern college students often draw from multiple   streams of student assistance to get the job done.</p>
<p>Federal programs play pivotal roles for cash-strapped college students, who use <a href="http://studentaid.ed.gov/types/grants-scholarships/pell" target="_blank">Pell Grants</a> and <a href="http://www.direct.ed.gov/" target="_blank">Federal Direct Loans</a> to meet financial obligations related to higher education.&nbsp; For all   college students, but especially those from unique student populations,   filing the standardized request for federal assistance is the first step   toward educational funding.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/" target="_blank">Free Application for Federal Student Aid</a> (FAFSA) gathers data about you and your family, including how many of   your siblings are attending college and how much income is earned within   your household.&nbsp; If you submit your FAFSA as a dependant filer, it   means you are claimed on your parents&rsquo; income tax return; so their   financial data must be included as well.&nbsp; Your FAFSA profile is used to   make important determinations about your ability to pay for college,   including your Expected Family Contribution (EFC).<img src="https://www.collegescholarships.org/images/diabetic-scholarships.jpg" width="293" height="410" class="alignright" alt="diabetic scholarships" /></p>
<p>By determining the amount you can contribute to your higher education bills (EFC), the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/" target="_blank">Department of Education</a> helps individual campuses arrive at precise need calculations for your   educational financing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once they know how much your education will   cost, and how much you can afford to pay, financial aid administrators   set about assembling&nbsp;assistance packages that draw from available   programs for which you are eligible.</p>
<p>If you are one of the thousands of students afflicted with diabetes,   your financial aid portfolio includes access to scholarships reserved   for diabetics.&nbsp; Once your federal and <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/states.htm">state-specific college aid</a> is exhausted, use these student-specific awards to cover remaining   college costs.&nbsp; Depending on the severity of your disease, you may also   qualify for general scholarship funding for students with disabilities.</p>
<p>Community groups, advocacy organizations, corporations and memorial foundations fund educational <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/disabilities.htm">scholarships for disabled students</a> and Diabetics.&nbsp;The following examples illustrate the types of college   assistance available to students with type1 and type 2 Diabetes.</p>
<h2>Non-Profit Groups Fund Scholarships for Diabetics</h2>
<p>Private foundations and nonprofit organizations are advocates for   individuals suffering with diabetes.&nbsp; Promoting research, increasing   patient access to health care and spreading diabetes education are   priority efforts made by groups that help diabetics.&nbsp; For some, this   mission also includes philanthropic educational support for student with   diabetes.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.wtt.com/page.aspx?article_id=1429" target="_blank">Novo Nordisk Donnelly Awards</a>&nbsp;were   established by Billie Jean King in 1998. This scholarship is available   to anyone between the ages of 12 and 21 who has diabetes and plays   tennis on a team or&nbsp;in a league. The awards are valued at $5,000 each,   and&nbsp;are intended to be applied to a recipients education, tennis   advancement or medical care.&nbsp; In addition to the two grand awards, six   annual $2500 awards are distributed regionally.</p>
<p>The Austin Community Foundation&nbsp;administrators the <a href="http://www.austincf.org/Scholarships/ApplyforaScholarship.aspx#67445-aimee-melissa-davis-scholarship" target="_blank">Aimee Melissa Davis Memorial Scholarship Fund</a>.   This award is disbursed annually to a graduating high school senior who   has Type I diabetes.&nbsp; The award honors Ms. Davis, who lost her battle   with juvenile diabetes before reaching adulthood.&nbsp; Applicants must be   accepted to four-year colleges to be considered for the scholarship,   which is currently worth $2000 to each winner.&nbsp; The number, and amount   of the annual scholarships offered varies based on available funding in   Aimee&rsquo;s endowment.  The Aimee Melissa Davis Memorial Scholarship  was established by family and friends to remember Aimee. Scholarships are given to graduating seniors from a high school within Travis, Williamson or Hays County Texas, living with a diagnosis of Type I Diabetes (insulin-dependent) with financial need and academic potential. </p>
<p>The Women&rsquo;s Board of the <a href="http://www.diabetesohio.org/GETINVOLVED/WomensBoard/DiabetesCollegeScholarship/tabid/168/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Central Ohio Diabetes Association</a> awards scholarships annually, to students who show the ability to   successfully manage their disease while maintaining exemplary academic   standards.&nbsp; Central Ohio residents are invited to apply, and will be   judged on scholastic merit and financial need.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.seefredtrust.org/" target="_blank">Thomas Seefred Trust </a>distributes   scholarships to Ohio students diagnosed with juvenile   diabetes.&nbsp;Qualified applicant&rsquo;s are pursuing bachelor&rsquo;s degrees.&nbsp; Awards   worth $3000 each are given to students exhibiting academic promise and   financial need.&nbsp; Tuition, fees, room and board are approved expenses,   and winner preference is given to applicants from three particular Ohio   counties.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.diabetesscholars.org/college.html" target="_blank">Diabetes Scholars Foundation</a> (DSF), a 501(c)(3) non-profit, provides college scholarships&nbsp;for   students in the United States with Type 1 diabetes.&nbsp; Scholarships are   not issued strictly based on financial need; nor are they designed to   stand solely&nbsp;as academic achievements.&nbsp; Administrators look at the whole   student, and consider factors like community involvement,   extracurricular activities, diabetes advocacy, and leadership   abilities.&nbsp;To qualify, each student must submit an essay and two letters   of recommendation; one each&nbsp;from&nbsp;a physicians and a high school   counselor or teacher.</p>
<p>Submitting&nbsp;a single DSF scholarship application places students in   consideration for all of the&nbsp;scholarships included in the DSF lineup.&nbsp;   Financial aid is distributed to diabetic students based on location,   academic major, participation in athletics and a host of other   individual characteristics.&nbsp; Application materials must be submitted by   May 15th.</p>
<p><a href="http://diabeteshopefoundation.com/" target="_blank">Diabetes Hope Foundation</a>&nbsp;has   been&nbsp;helping to educate diabetics since 1999, with&nbsp;a variety of   scholarships for students with Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes. The   educational awards recognize exceptional students who have illustrated   success managing their illnesses, all the while&nbsp;engaging in   extracurricular and community activities.&nbsp; Over 400 students   have&nbsp;received help from the Hope&nbsp;Scholarship Fund to date, thanks   to&nbsp;generous support&nbsp;from public and private sponsors.</p>
<p>With help from corporate sponsors like Nordisk and Bayer, The <a href="http://www.diabeteseducator.org/Foundation/Awards/" target="_blank">American Association of Diabetes Educators</a> distributes several scholarships for stand-out educators.&nbsp; The   scholarships target several groups, including pharmacy students and   others showing promise within diabetes related education professions.</p>
<h2>College/University Scholarships for Diabetics</h2>
<p>Many institutions of higher learning distribute campus-specific   scholarships&nbsp;specifically to the diabetic students who are enrolled at   their schools.&nbsp; At <a href="http://www.asu.edu/studentaffairs/ed/drc/scholarships.htm" target="_blank">Arizona State University</a> (ASU) for example, students with juvenile diabetes are eligible to   apply for the &nbsp;Julie Sargent Memorial Scholarship.&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-time candidates   benefit from this ASU program if they are&nbsp;Arizona residents pursuing   undergraduate degrees.</p>
<p>University of Florida <a href="http://diabetes.ufl.edu/2012/04/16/college-scholarships-available/" target="_blank">Diabetes Center of Excellence</a> administers the Diabetes Scholars Program on campus annually.&nbsp;   Activities related to diabetes management and participation within the   diabetes community are strong qualifiers for students pursuing this   award.&nbsp; Academic achievement and level of extracurricular engagement are   also selection criteria.</p>
<p>To access a larger pool of scholarship possibilities, students with   diabetes pursue disabilities scholarships designed to help a cross   section of physically and intellectually impaired groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;Scholarships   for disabled students are put forth by a wide variety of public and   private sources, so they are each unique in their conditions and   requirements.&nbsp; Some grants and scholarships are specifically inclusive   of those with diabetes, while others prohibit their participation.&nbsp;   Financial aid offices and program administrators provide up-to-date   information about disabilities scholarship terms and qualifications.</p>
<p>State-specific aid for diabetics is also disbursed&nbsp;on individual campuses.&nbsp; The <a href="http://johnekostic.org/areas-of-focus/scholarships/diabetes-scholarship/" target="_blank">John E. Kostic Scholarship</a> benefits incoming freshmen within the State of New Jersey.&nbsp; Resident   students with Type 1 Diabetes qualify for college resources by exhibit   high academic standards, strong extracurricular records and proficient   diabetes management.&nbsp; Successful applicants are pursuing bachelor&rsquo;s   degrees at accredited 4-year schools.</p>
