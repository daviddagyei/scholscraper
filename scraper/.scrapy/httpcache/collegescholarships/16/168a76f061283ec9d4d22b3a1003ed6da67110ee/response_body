      <h2>  Available Scholarships for Teachers    </h2>
	  
<p>Grants, loans and especially scholarships are administered&nbsp;based on a   wide&nbsp;range of variables. Qualifications attached to&nbsp;financial aid&nbsp;are   sometimes broad, but can also be very specific.&nbsp; For example, general   need-based aid requires only that an applicant exhibit financial need   during college, which opens&nbsp;eligibility to almost everyone with a   tuition bill.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some financial aid funds are reserved for specific   functions, like helping certain groups succeed, or encouraging academic   excellence in specific areas.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/other-minority-scholarships.htm">Minority scholarships</a> and grants, for instance, target select groups to receive tuition assistance for college.</p>
<p>When the supply of well-trained professionals isn&rsquo;t meeting the   demand, financial aid is used to encourage students to go into certain   fields.&nbsp; Targeted aid of this type is attractive to students who have   not chosen a major, and to those who are already working toward degrees   in high-demand fields.</p>
<p><strong>Currently, college students pursuing teaching degrees are rewarded with privileged access to unique financial aid opportunities</strong>.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://www.collegescholarships.org/images/scholarships-for-teachers.jpg" width="425" height="282" alt="teachers scholarships" /></div>
<p>Elementary and secondary schools that enroll primarily low income   children are suffering from&nbsp;shortages of competent teachers.&nbsp; As a   result, pro-education efforts &ndash; including college tuition assistance   -&nbsp;are originated at&nbsp;federal, state and local levels.&nbsp; Now, more than   ever, undergraduates and graduate students are awarded career-specific   college financial&nbsp;aid to pursue teaching credentials.</p>
<p>As an aspiring teacher, you are eligible for general financial aid   too, but your pool of resources is instantly deepened by concerted   efforts to bring qualified graduates to the profession.&nbsp; Government   sources, professional associations and other private entities provide   funding for grants and scholarships that serve education majors.</p>
<p>Teacher aid varies from performance based scholarships, to   tuition-for-service agreements that require teaching commitments   following graduation.&nbsp; Generally, grants are need-based and free of   performance indicators.&nbsp; Scholarships, on the other hand, are often   attached to&nbsp;eligibility standards like GPA.&nbsp; Both are free-money aid   that doesn&rsquo;t get paid back, so your bottom-line impact is the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>State and Local Teaching Scholarships</h2>
<p>Consult with your school&rsquo;s financial aid office for up to   date&nbsp;information about specific&nbsp;teaching scholarships in your area.&nbsp; If   you&rsquo;re just getting started in college, don&rsquo;t overlook aid offered by   your school or state. And if you&rsquo;re nearing graduation, ask about   scholarships that can be used to pay living expenses during your student   teaching assignments.</p>
<p>While local teaching scholarships are often less rich than national   awards,&nbsp;smaller applicant pools make them less competitive. Combine   these smaller awards with larger scholarships to piece together your   financial aid package.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.marquette.edu/grad/finaid_mketeachers.shtml" target="_blank">Milwaukee Area Teachers Scholarship</a>&nbsp;-   Marquette university supports working teachers with this tuition   credit.&nbsp; If you are employed as a Wisconsin teacher, Marquette pays for   half of a college class you take each semester.&nbsp; The flexible award does   not require degree candidacy or other enrollment requirements, and is   an example of one type of continuing education incentive available to   teachers.</li>
  <li>West Virginia college students are eligible for&nbsp;<a href="https://content.xap.com/media/4407/uwsnewapplication.pdf" target="_blank">Underwood-Smith Teacher Scholarships</a>,   which can amount to $5000 annually.&nbsp; This example of   tuition-for-service financial aid requires each recipient to work within   the West Virginia school system for a period of two years for each year   the scholarship is received.&nbsp; The teaching commitment is reduced to   one-year, provided the teacher is employed at a high-need shortage-area   school.</li>
  <li>Wisconsin Early Childhood Association, through its <a href="http://wisconsinearlychildhood.org/programs/teach/" target="_blank">T.E.A.C.H. Early Childhood Wisconsin</a>,   is in the business of granting tailor-made tuition solutions to   deserving, committed Wisconsin education professionals.&nbsp; The association   has doled-out over 7000 scholarships since 1999, to aid professional   development in early childhood education.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.teachnycprograms.net/getpage.php?page_id=71" target="_blank">Teachers of Tomorrow</a> is a New York City Department of Education program devoted to   recruiting qualified staffers to teach in the city&rsquo;s most challenging   schools.&nbsp; Tuition reimbursement and other incentives are used to bring   qualified professionals to faculty positions at New York&rsquo;s highest-need   schools.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.kheaa.com/website/kheaa/teacher?main=1" target="_blank">Kentucky Higher Education Assistance Authority</a> offers college aid to full-time, resident students pursuing teaching   credentials within the state.&nbsp; Students who&nbsp;are juniors&nbsp;and beyond are   eligible for up to $2500 each semester, under this program.&nbsp; When   funding permits, freshmen and sophomores also&nbsp;qualify for&nbsp;scholarships.</li>
  <li>Corporate sponsors generously fund college scholarships for students studying primary and secondary education.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/citizenship/education.html" target="_blank">Coca-Cola Foundation</a>&nbsp;supports   education at international universities through its Coca-Cola Scholars   initiative.&nbsp; Schools like Emory University use Coke dollars to fund   scholarship programs for would-be teachers.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>National Teaching Scholarships</h2>
<p>National scholarships for education majors&nbsp;target future teachers,   sometimes showing preference toward candidates studying in specific   subject areas. These scholarships include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Federal Government is the largest source of general financial   aid, but Uncle Sam also runs programs targeting specific vocational   pursuits.&nbsp; The <a href="http://studentaid.ed.gov/types/grants-scholarships/teach" target="_blank">Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education Grant</a>&nbsp;(TEACH)   is a government initiative aimed at recruiting college graduates to   teach in under-served areas..&nbsp; Individual states run similar   tuition-for-service programs that require&nbsp;students who receive   assistance to work in specific jobs following graduation.&nbsp; TEACH   recipients are each eligible for up to $4000 annually, in exchange for a   four-year teaching commitment at&nbsp;a school that serves low-income   students.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.afcea.org/education/scholarships/undergraduate/TeachersScholarship.asp" target="_blank">AFCEA</a> is an international organization dedicated to the ethical exchange of   information.&nbsp; This IT and communications association provides   scholarships annually, to students earning an education in the field of   teaching.&nbsp; Each year, 50 students who pursue STEM-related teaching   degrees are awarded scholarships valued at $5000 each.&nbsp; Graduate and   undergraduates are considered for the scholarships, which require a 3.0   GPA.</li>
  <li><a href="http://nsfnoyce.org/" target="_blank">Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship</a>&nbsp;is   administered as an institutional program that provides funding to   colleges, which they&nbsp;in turn distribute to worthy candidates pursuing   education degrees.&nbsp;The awards specifically target K-12 educators   teaching in math and science disciplines.</li>
  <li>Alpha Kappa Alpha&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.akaeaf.org/undergraduate_scholarships.htm" target="_blank">Education Advancement Foundation</a> furthers the sorority&rsquo;s mission to promote educational excellence   through several scholarship programs for member-students.&nbsp; The   foundation devotes a certain portion of its scholarship funding to   students&nbsp;who are&nbsp;education majors.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.pdkintl.org/awards/prospective.htm" target="_blank">Phi Delta Kappa</a> International Education Foundation awards scholarships of up to $1,000   annually, to high school seniors and current undergraduates pursuing   careers in elementary or secondary education. PDK sponsors the <a href="http://www.futureeducators.org/scholarships/index.htm" target="_blank">Future Educators Association</a>, administering more than 30 scholarships each year &ndash; exclusively for future teachers.</li>
  <li>National Board for Professional Teaching Standards offers its own <a href="http://www.nbpts.org/become_a_candidate/fees_financial_support/scholarships" target="_blank">scholarships for teachers</a>.&nbsp; in many cases, awards are funded by private enterprise, including Liberty Mutual insurance, Boeing and Chase.</li>
  <li>Montessori is a teaching philosophy and educational movement   dedicated to a core set of teaching principles.&nbsp; Students who wish to   become Montessori teachers are encouraged by the <a href="http://www.amshq.org/About%20AMS/What%20We%20Are%20Doing/Awards%20and%20Grants/Teacher%20Education%20Scholarships.aspx" target="_blank">American Montessori Society</a>,   through a series of education scholarships for attending AMS schools.&nbsp;   Awards vary, but the society&rsquo;s Zell Scholarship is worth $1000 annually.</li>
  <li>Bright Horizons Family Solutions, the world&rsquo;s leading provider of employer-sponsored early care, offers four <a href="http://www.brighthorizons.com/careers/brightfutures.aspx" target="_blank">Bright Futures Scholarships</a> worth $2,500 each, for full-time students currently pursuing degrees in   early childhood education. Applicants must each submit an essay,   resume, transcript, and letters of recommendation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Diversity Scholarships</h2>
<p>Teachers act as role models for a diverse student body, so qualified   educators must be drawn from a wide cross-section of cultures and social   groups.&nbsp; Some teaching scholarships specifically promote diversity by   offering incentives to minorities and other groups that are   under-represented in the field of education.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.hsf.net/" target="_blank">Hispanic Scholarship Fund</a> partners with corporations and other donors to break down educational   barriers for Latino students.&nbsp; Wells-Fargo and other big-name   benefactors work with HSF to promote&nbsp;Hispanic education&nbsp;through   scholarships and other initiatives that support education.&nbsp; HSF   scholarship applications are&nbsp;submitted online.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.naacp.org/page/s/scholarship2" target="_blank">NAACP</a> issues education scholarships to teaching students.&nbsp; Awards change   periodically, but the organization recently awarded Sutton Education   Scholarships worth $1000 to undergraduates, and $2000 to master&rsquo;s degree   candidates.</li>
  <li>The Siemens Foundation has partnered with the <a href="http://www.thurgoodmarshallfund.net/" target="_blank">Thurgood Marshall Scholarship Fund</a> and the <a href="http://www.uncf.org/" target="_blank">United Negro College Fund</a> to award&nbsp;scholarships to undergraduate and graduate education   students&nbsp;attending historically black colleges&nbsp;and universities.   Preference is given to applicants pursuing math&nbsp;and science teaching   credentials.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.nfb.org/scholarship-program" target="_blank">National Federation of the Blind</a> Educator of Tomorrow Scholarship is worth $3,000&nbsp;to a blind recipient   planning a career in elementary, secondary, or post-secondary teaching.   The scholarship is awarded based on the applicant&rsquo;s record of scholastic   excellence, financial need and community involvement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Scholarships are bundled with other financial aid, including <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/grants/teachers.htm">grants for teachers</a> and student&nbsp;loans. And if you are a would-be teacher, who is also female, you might be eligible for <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/women.htm">women&rsquo;s scholarships</a> and <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/grants/women.htm">grants</a>.</p>
