<h2>Take Your Pick of Specialization</h2>

<p>Medical disciplines are suffering from inadequate educational   recruiting levels across the country &ndash; leading to shortages of qualified   graduates and medical service providers.&nbsp; As a result, unique funding   opportunities exist for college students who choose health related   majors.&nbsp; Specialized training to become physician&rsquo;s assistants, lab   technologists,<a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/nursing.htm"> nurses</a>, <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/grants/physical.htm">physical therapists</a>, imaging professionals and other medical staffers leads to grants and loans reserved for health care students.</p>
<p>Financial aid programs for health and medical sciences are divided   into two general categories;&nbsp; need-based assistance and merit-based   awards.&nbsp; Scholarships reward outstanding performance in academics, <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/athletic.htm">athletics</a> and other scholastic disciplines, so they are&nbsp;competitive merit-based   resources that have unique individual eligibility requirements.&nbsp;   Scholarships designed to help certain student groups like <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/women.htm">women</a> and <a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/other-minority-scholarships.htm">minorities</a> are found throughout education; including health and medical programs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.collegescholarships.org/grants/medical.htm">Grants</a> usually address the college funding needs of financially disadvantaged   applicants.&nbsp; Large federal financial assistance programs like <a href="http://studentaid.ed.gov/types/grants-scholarships/pell" target="_blank">Pell Grants</a> are more inclusive, but still issued based on need.&nbsp; Some scholarships   also include need components that pair student excellence with financial   need to evaluate applicants and determine recipients.&nbsp; Successful   student aid-seekers employ a top down approach that starts with the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/" target="_blank">U.S.Department of Education</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.collegescholarships.org/images/health-science-scholarships.jpg" width="425" class="aligncenter" height="282" alt="health science scholarships" /></p>
<p>File your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) first, and   then target scholarships aimed at your health sciences education.&nbsp; Some   medical scholarship administrators use <a href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/" target="_blank">FAFSA data</a> to evaluate your worthiness, so make sure to file timely; according to   your school&rsquo;s deadline.&nbsp; Once the wheels are in motion, health-related   scholarships emerge from public and private sources like government   agencies, private corporations and individual medical school   departments.</p>
<h2>As the Industry Grows, So Do Your Choices in College</h2>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/" target="_blank">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>,   the health care industry is expected to grow by more than 25% through   2017; compared to the combined growth of all other industries which&nbsp;are   fore-casted to advance at only 14%.&nbsp; As baby-boomers enter their prime   years for requiring health care services, more practitioners are   required to meet increasing demand.&nbsp; As a result, universities and other   scholarship administrators work to provide financing options for health   sciences majors.</p>
<h2>General Health Sciences Scholarships</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www4.uwm.edu/chs/" target="_blank"> University of Wisconsin &ndash; Milwaukee College of Health Sciences</a> awards a number of&nbsp; Health Sciences Department scholarships aimed at specific target student groups:</p>
<ul>
  <li>New Freshman Scholarships extend merit-based awards&nbsp;worth $1,000   each to&nbsp;incoming freshman. Successful applicants demonstrate scholastic   proficiency with GPA standards of at least 3.0.&nbsp; Extracurricular   activities and community involvement also influence award decisions.</li>
  <li>New Transfer Student Scholarships offers transfer students   opportunities to enter the CHS program with awards worth up to $1,000   each. 3.0 GPA required.</li>
  <li>Froedtert Minority Scholarships reward qualified minority students   with health sciences department awards worth up to $1,000 each.   Scholarships are merit-based and competitive.</li>
  <li>The annual Illinois Scholar Award goes to a resident of Illinois   enrolled in the Health Services Department. Recipients are outstanding   academically and participate in extracurricular activities.</li>
  <li>The Outstanding Achievement Award is given annually, to an undergraduate student who is nominated by faculty.</li>
  <li>CHS Alumni Association Scholarships benefit undergraduate and   graduate students with supplemental funding worth $600 to each   participant. Academics and extracurricular activities are considered as   part of the application process.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://hs.boisestate.edu/" target="_blank">Boise State University College of Health Sciences</a> offers the President Charles and Sally Ruch Inaugural Health Science   Scholarship. Successful applicants are studying in their sophomore years   and&nbsp;maintain&nbsp;cumulative GPA levels of at least 3.0 on a four point   scale.&nbsp; The school&rsquo;s College of Health Sciences offers courses in   occupational health, health infomatics, pre-medical studies, addiction   studies and other health-related disciplines.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ipfw.edu/tapestry/scholarship.htm" target="_blank">Tapestry Parkview Health Sciences Scholarships</a> support health-related education for participating women.&nbsp; The advocacy   group initiates scholarships annually that are worth $2500 for each   recipient. Academic excellence is the primary eligibility requirement   for this women&rsquo;s only financial assistance for health and human services   majors.</p>
<h2>States and Schools Fund Health and Medical Education</h2>
<p>The State of West Virginia administers a targeted program for degree   candidates enrolled in health and medical programs.&nbsp; West Virginia <a href="http://secure.cfwv.com/Financial_Aid_Planning/Scholarships/Scholarships_and_Grants/WV_Health_Sciences_Scholarship_Program.aspx" target="_blank">Health Sciences Scholarships</a>&nbsp;are   intended to keep some of the state&rsquo;s medical students practicing within   the state, upon graduation.&nbsp; Recruitment incentives worth as much   as&nbsp;$20,000 in tuition offsets are available for qualified applicants   pursuing&nbsp;medical or health services credentials at West Virginia   universities. In exchange for generous financial assistance for health   education, some recipients agree to work at state-designated high-need   medical facilities within West Virginia.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.med.unc.edu/ahs/student-services/dept-of-allied-health-sciences" target="_blank">UNC School of Medicine &ndash; Department of Allied Health Sciences</a> puts forth several financial aid initiatives for promising health and   medical students.&nbsp; Diversity scholarships benefit minority applicants,   and fellowships target specific research areas.&nbsp; The Medical Alumni   Association Loyalty Fund sets financial resources aside for qualified   students each year.&nbsp; Four distinct programs originate from the funding   body annually.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nwhealth.edu/financial-aid/grants-scholarships/" target="_blank">Northwestern Health Sciences University</a> requires financial aid applicants to pursue federal aid by filing FAFSA   applications.&nbsp; Once each student&rsquo;s financial aid needs are evaluated,   the school uses campus-specific resources to manage college expenses for   new and continuing students.&nbsp; Acupuncture, massage therapy,   chiropractic and oriental medicine programs are supported.</p>
<h2>Medical Sciences Scholarships</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.goldmanpartnerships.org/Culpeper/Culpeper%20Medical%20Scholars%20Info.htm" target="_blank">Charles Culpeper Scholarships in Medical Science </a>are   funded by Goldman Philanthropic Partnerships and the Rockefeller   Brothers Fund. Awards target academic physicians who are continuing   research at accredited medical schools in the U.S. Valuable scholarship   awards are worth more than $100,000 each for worthy recipients.&nbsp;   Scholarships are competitive and renewable for up to three years for   qualified candidates.</p>

This&nbsp;merit-based award is reserved for Chemistry specialists who are   also members of the school&rsquo;s Chemistry Club.&nbsp; Additional departmental   scholarships benefit particular programs and assist health sciences   majors with tuition and expenses.</p>
<p>Indiana University automatically considers all health sciences students for campus-based <a href="http://msa.medicine.iu.edu/financial-aid/financial-aid-guide/offered-through-iusm" target="_blank">Bloomington Medical Sciences Scholarships</a>.   The school&rsquo;s portfolio of scholarships is made possible by generous   funding from alumni, friends of education, foundations and private   corporations.&nbsp; Investing is the future of medicine honors benefactors   and memorializes individual&nbsp;scholarship namesakes.&nbsp; Financially needy   and academically deserving candidates are selected to receive awards   like:</p>
