      <h2>Serving Those That Have Served Their Country </h2>
      <p>The men and women who serve in the United States military, regardless   of branch, deserve the honor, respect and thanks of a grateful nation.   While no single act can truly thank the brave men and women who have   served their country faithfully, we, as a nation, can at least provide   them with greater opportunity here at home. Education grants and   scholarships for military personnel, veterans, and their families is one   way the United States thanks their servicemen and women.</p>
      <p>Scholarships and grants for veterans are supported by the Federal   government, as well as by military associations, universities and   private donors. After the sacrifices made by our military personnel and   their families, it is only fitting they we help them to find new   opportunities and greater successes here at home.</p>
      <h2>Federal Programs for Veterans</h2>
      <p>Since the earliest days of the G.I Bill, the Federal government has   been devoted to helping returning veterans find the funds they need to   obtain a college education. As times have changed, so have the   government&rsquo;s financial aid programs for military veterans and their   families. While programs continue to change with the times, the Federal   resolve remains constant. These financial aid programs exist to help   returning veterans define their own success at home by giving them much   needed encouragement and support in their quest for a college education.</p>
      <p><img src="https://www.collegescholarships.org/images/military-scholarships.jpg" width="425" height="282" alt="military scholarships"  class="aligncenter"/></p>
      <h2>The Montgomery G.I. Bill</h2>
      <p>The G.I. Bill is one of the most well known financial aid programs in   the United States. It is no exaggeration to say that the introduction   of the <a href="http://www.gibill.va.gov/" target="_blank">Montgomery G.I. Bill</a> changed the face of the nation by giving returning veterans access to   higher education. In many ways, the G.I. Bill built the new middle class   that would become the backbone of the United States. The G.I. Bill has   undergone many changes since its inception, but it continues to provide   much needed financial assistance to veterans who wish to pursue a   college education.</p>
      <p>Montgomery G.I. Bill benefits are available to military personnel who   have agreed to have $100 withheld from their monthly pay allowance.   Servicemen can also opt to have an addition $600 deducted from their   monthly pay in order to receive greater benefits following their   discharge from active service. The amount of financial aid available   through the G.I. Bill will vary, and will depend on time served, and the   contributions of the individual serviceman or woman. Typically,   service-members who have received an honorable discharge are eligible   for up to 36 months of education benefits, or roughly $37,000.</p>
      <p>The G.I. Bill is also available to reservists, and members of the   National Guard, who have opted to pay into the program during their time   of service. For these auxiliary members of the military, total   education benefits will be approximately $11,000.</p>
      <p>G.I. Bill benefits can be used toward tuition costs at accredited   colleges, universities and vocational schools across the country.   Benefits include funding for tuition, housing, books and other ancillary   college costs. All benefits are contingent upon the individuals term of   military service, course of study and reserve status. Montgomery G.I.   Bill benefits are payable up to ten years following the service-members   release from active service.</p>
      <h2>The Post 9/11 G. I. Bill</h2>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.gibill.va.gov/benefits/post_911_gibill/index.html" target="_blank">Post 9/11 G. I. Bill</a> was passed into law in 2009, and is an extension of the aforementioned   Montgomery G. I. Bill. It was specifically designed to benefit   servicemen and women who saw active duty immediately following the   events of September 11, 2001. To be eligible, military personnel must   have enlisted withing 90 days of September 10, 2001. Particular   attention is given to those service-members who have been discharged due   to a service related disability.</p>
      <p>The Post 9/11 Bill provides 36 months of financial assistance to   eligible service-members who are pursuing a post-secondary education at   an accredited college, university or technical school. Full tuition,   including housing, books and attendant fees, will be paid for those   servicemen and women who are enrolled in a public university or college.   Veterans who choose to pursue their education at a private college or   university, may apply for additional benefits through the <a href="http://www.gibill.va.gov/benefits/post_911_gibill/yellow_ribbon_program.html" target="_blank">Yellow Ribbon Project.<br />
      </a></p>
      <p>Post 9/11 G.I. Bill benefits are available to veterans pursuing   undergraduate and graduate level studies at an accredited college or   university, as well as to veterans pursuing courses at an approved   vocational or technical school. Benefits are awarded based on time   served, manner of deployment and are contingent on veterans receiving an   honorable discharge.</p>
      <h2>National Scholarships for Veterans</h2>
      <p>In addition to the G.I..Bill, and the Post 9/11 G.I. Bill, there are a   wide variety of available scholarships designed to encourage and   support veterans in their quest for a college education. These   scholarships are supported by both public and private funds, and are   offered to eligible veterans who have been honorably discharged from   military service. Requirements and award amounts will vary according to   the program.</p>
      <p>The following examples are just a small sampling of scholarships designed to benefit veterans and their families.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <a href="http://www.amvets.org/pdfs/programs_pdfs/programs_scholarship_application_veteran.pdf" target="_blank">AMVET National Scholarship Program</a> is designed for those veterans who have exhausted the resources of the   G.I. Bill. Applicants must have been honorably discharged, and must be   attending an accredited college, university or technical school. The   award is $1000 per academic year, renewable for up to three years.</li>
        <li>The <a href="http://www.purpleheart.org/scholarships/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Military Order of the Purple Heart Scholarship</a> is available to all veterans who have been awarded the Purple Heart.

Department of Defense, and provides   financial support for veterans who choose to pursue a degree in teaching   or education. Eligible applicants must agree to a term of service in a   high need school or community in order to receive funding. Eligibility   is determined by financial need, as well as academic merit.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Veterans Scholarships From Colleges and Universities</h2>
      <p>Many colleges and universities across the country have Divisions, or   Offices, of Veteran&rsquo;s Affairs on their campuses. Their purpose is to   make transition to civilian life easier, while offering financial   assistance for servicemen and women who wish to pursue a college   education. Available programs will vary from college to college, and all   veterans and active-duty military personnel are encouraged to check   with their school to see what programs are in place to help them achieve   their educational goals.</p>
      <p>The examples that follow will provide a glimpse of the types of   programs being offered to both active and retired military personnel   through the auspices of their own college or university.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://finaid.msu.edu/veterans.asp" target="_blank">Michigan State University&rsquo;s Office of Veterans Affairs</a> supports a number of financial aid programs, including the <em><strong>MSU Disabled Veterans Assistance Program</strong></em>.   The program offers new, and returning, undergraduate veterans with a   military-related disability financial support to complete their college   education. Expenses covered include full tuition, housing, books and   related college costs.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.grantham.edu/tuition/scholarships/" target="_blank">Grantham University</a> offers a number of military-related scholarships, including the <a href="http://www.grantham.edu/tuition/military-programs/military-scholarship-program-service-members/" target="_blank">Military Service Members Scholarship</a>, the <a href="http://www.grantham.edu/tuition/military-programs/military-severely-injured-scholarship/" target="_blank">Military Severely Injured Scholarship</a> and the <a href="http://www.grantham.edu/tuition/military-programs/veterans-scholarship/" target="_blank">Military Veterans Scholarship</a>.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.deanza.edu/veterans/" target="_blank">De Anza College</a> offers scholarships for veterans who have been injured in the line of   duty. Applicants must have a minimum 2.5 GPA, and must maintain an   enrollment of at least 6 credit hours per quarter. All applicants must   have sustained an injury in combat. Awards are $2,000, and are   determined by financial need.</li>
      </ul>
      <h1>Financial Aid for Active Service</h1>
      <p>Military service has long been a stepping stone to higher education.   Those serving in all branches of the U.S. Military, as well as   reservists,veterans and their families, have access to a wide range of   valuable financial assistance programs designed to make higher education   more accessible. Many branches of the military offer substantial grants   and scholarships, as well as loan repayment programs, for active and   retired service-members and their families.</p>
      <h2>ROTC</h2>
      <p>The Reserve Officers Training Corps, or <a href="http://www.todaysmilitary.com/before-serving-in-the-military/rotc-programs?campaign_id=SEM2012:on:google:ROTC-rotc_scholarship:broad" target="_blank">ROTC</a> is one of the most popular sources for military-related scholarships.   Most high schools and colleges in the country have some level of ROTC   presence on their campuses. The ROTC offers students the opportunity to   receive financial assistance for college while training to take their   place as officers in one of the many branches of the U.S. Military.</p>
      <p>ROTC programs are in place for each of the major military branches, including the <a href="http://www.goarmy.com/rotc.html" target="_blank">Army</a>, the <a href="http://www.navy.com/joining/education-opportunities/nrotc/" target="_blank">Navy</a>, the <a href="http://www.afrotc.com/" target="_blank">Air Force</a> and the <a href="http://officer.marines.com/marine/making_marine_officers/cp1/nrotc?WT.mc_id=TODAYSMILITARYOFFROTC" target="_blank">Marines</a>.   Students enlisting in an ROTC program must agree to take a series of   military science courses, in preparation for an agreed upon term of   service in the related branch of the armed forces. In exchange for this   term of service, students receive financial aid to cover the costs of   tuition, housing and books.</p>
      <p>The ROTC is the foundation of all military-related financial, and has   provided many students with the necessary funds to obtain a college   education. However, students considering the ROTC should understand that   they are agreeing to a contract that requires military service. While   the ROTC is a good source for college funding, it should not be entered   into lightly.</p>
      <h2>Scholarships and Grants from Every Branch of the Military</h2>
      <p>Financial aid for active-duty service-members is available from every   branch of the U. S. Military. Scholarships, grants and tuition   assistance programs are often used as recruiting incentives, and offer   educational opportunities in exchange for military service. While this   is a very viable, and rewarding, way to find funding for college,   students should note that these programs require service commitments.   Recipients must agree to a predetermined term of service in the military   in order to receive awards. Enlisting in any brand of the military is   an honorable decision, but it is not to be taken without due   consideration.</p>
      <p>The following examples will show the breadth of financial aid   programs available to enlisted servicemen and women, as well as to their   spouses and dependents.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <a href="http://www.military.com/education/money-for-school/air-force-tuition-assistance.html" target="_blank">Air Force Tuition Assistance Program</a> offers financial aid to active-duty personnel who wish to complete   their college education while enlisted. Funds can be applied to either   on-base, or off-base, schools. Award amounts are contingent upon time   served, and range from partial to full tuition grants.</li>
        <li>The <a href="http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/career/education/GIBill/Pages/NCF.aspx" target="_blank">Navy College Fund</a> offers funding for enlisted sailors over and above what they are   eligible to receive from the G. I. Bill. The purpose of the fund is to   assist both active-duty and retired Navy personnel in the completion of a   college education. Applicants must have an honorable standing in the   service, and must meet general service and performance requirements.</li>
        <li>The <a href="http://www.nmcrs.org/" target="_blank">Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society</a> administers a number of grants and low interest loan programs for service-members, their spouses and dependents, including the <a href="http://www.nmcrs.org/goldstar.pdf" target="_blank">Gold Star Scholarship</a> and the <a href="http://www.nmcrs.org/boorda.html" target="_blank">Admiral Mike Boorda Loan Program</a>. Financial aid amounts vary, and are determined by time of service and financial need.</li>
        <li>The <a href="http://gibill.va.gov/benefits/other_programs/dea.html" target="_blank">U.S. Army&rsquo;s Survivors and Dependents Assistance Program</a> provides financial aid to the widowed spouses and children of   service-members who were killed, or disabled, in the line of duty. The   program offers up to 45 months of education benefits to be used while   pursuing either a degree or certification at an accredited college or   technical school.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Military service is a brave, and honorable, choice that offers more   than just financial rewards. They who have given so much, deserve the   educational support and encouragement of a grateful nation. Veterans,   active-duty personnel, and their families rightfully have access to a   wide range of scholarships and grants to enable them to pursue a college   education, and to find lasting success on the home-front.</p>
